C. Hansen''' or simply '''H. C.''',  was a Danish politician who served as Prime Minister of Denmark from 1955 until his death in 1960.\nA [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrat]], Hansen served as finance minister in the unity cabinet from May to November 1945 and again from 1947 to 1950 under [[Hans Hedtoft]]. He served as minister of industry, commerce and seafare in the final month of Hedtoft's first cabinet, and later became foreign minister in 1953, and continued in this post during his own premiership until 1958. He was elected leader of his party following the death of Hedtoft.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/hc-hansen/|title =H.C. Hansen, 1906-1960|website=danmarkshistorien.dk|access-date=1 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nHe was the son of Christian Hansen (1875–1944) and Helene Helene Margrethe Sperling (1876–1933).\nHe attended Samsøgades School until 7th grade. He continued his education as a typist apprentice.\nHe was a secretary and later chairman in the [[Social Democratic Youth of Denmark|Social Democratic Youth]] and became a member of [[Folketinget|parliament]] in 1936.\n\n==Political career==\nAs Foreign Minister, H. C. Hansen was seen as the natural successor as Prime Minister and leader of the Social Democrats, when his friend [[Hans Hedtoft]] died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on 29 January 1955. In addition to becoming Prime Minister, H. C. Hansen also retained the post as Foreign Minister until 1958. Among the laws passed by this government included the universal people's pension and the enactment of agricultural price supports. The law on assistance to single mothers of April 1955 introduced special assistance for widows with children and certain other categories of single women, while under the Accident Insurance Act of 1959, an independent board of appeal was set up, waiting times were reduced, compensation for survivors was converted from lump sums into running benefits, and the scheme extended to cover occupational diseases. Under a law on relations between trade union a and employers’ associations, passed in April 1956, as an offshoot of collective agreement on the labour market, a new scheme provided sickness cash benefits significantly higher than in the existing health insurance scheme. The new scheme only covered members of trade unions and those employed by members of the Danish Employers’ Association. In addition, under the Apprenticeship Act of September 1956, theoretical training was introduced at technical schools as part of apprenticeship training. In 1956, universal pension coverage in Denmark was introduced, while the Survivors’ Pension Act of March 1959 introduced a general survivors’ pension scheme, including specific provisions for single women having reached age 60. In 1959, a law was enacted that led to the establishment of the Mental Retardation Service and a decentralised regional system of services for those with intellectual disabilities. That same year, an extension of covered occupational diseases in work injury compensation was carried out. In 1958, an education reform was enacted that reduced educational barriers.<ref>{{cite web|url=  https://www.visitaarhus.com/aarhus/erkunden/hans-hedtoft-gdk646444|title=Hans Hedtoft|website=visitaarhus.com|access-date=1 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://dansketaler.dk/taler/hansen-hans-christian-svane/|title=Statsminister H.C.

After the election H. C. Hansen was able to partner with the [[Danish Social Liberal Party]] (''Radikale Venstre'') and [[Justice Party of Denmark]] (''Retsforbundet'') to form the [[Cabinet of H.C. Hansen II]], also known as the ''Triangle Cabinet'' (''Trekantsregeringen'').<ref>{{cite web|url=https://danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/folketingsvalget-1957/|title=Folketingsvalget 1957|website=danmarkshistorien.dk|access-date=1 November 2019}}</ref>\n \nOn 25 March 1957 France, [[West Germany]], Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg signed the [[Treaty of Rome]] to create the [[European Economic Community]]. To not be left behind the Danish government first wanted to join a Nordic [[free trade]] organization, but that failed and Denmark joined the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA) on 3 May 1960 instead. Unlike his successors as Social Democratic leaders and prime minister, Hansen did not support Denmark joining the European Economic Community that eventually took place in 1972.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.efta.int/about-efta/european-free-trade-association|title=About EFTA |website=The European Free Trade Association|access-date=1 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nH.

Characters in these stories often encounter scenarios that involve [[space exploration]], [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrials]], [[time travel]], [[Parallel universes in fiction|parallel universes]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[robot]]s, and [[human cloning]]. Despite the focus on fictional settings and time periods, science fiction podcasts regularly contain or reference locations, events, or people from the real world. The intended audience of a science fiction podcast can vary from young children to adults. Science fiction podcasts developed out of [[radio drama]]s. Science fiction podcasts are a subgenre of fiction podcasts and are distinguished from fantasy podcasts and [[horror podcast]]s by the absence of magical or macabre themes, respectively, though these subgenres regularly overlap. Science fiction podcasts have often been adapted into [[Fantasy television|television programs]], [[graphic novel]]s, and [[comics]].\n\n==Genre and subgenres==\nScience fiction podcasts often focus on themes such as time travel, space exploration, robots, and artificial intelligence.

The community had a school, [[post office]], and church to serve the needs of the population.\n\nAs time wore on, the population dwindled and farming became less attractive with the rocky and clay soil conditions. Today, forestry and construction are the only means of employment for the community's small population. Many of the residents commute to locations as far away as [[Fredericton]] and [[Woodstock, New Brunswick|Woodstock]] to work. Home construction boomed in the mid and late 1990s as several new cottages were constructed on the shores of [[East Grand Lake (New Brunswick)|East Grand Lake]].\n\nToday, few people reside in the small border community, with the number of summer cottage owners likely surpassing the number of full-time residents.\n\nThe following is how Inez (Foster) Lounder described the community as recorded in her notes December 20, 1910:\n\n<blockquote>Green Mountain is situated on the Eastern bank of the [[Grand Chipineticook Lake]], [[Grand Lake (New Brunswick)|Grand Lake]] being one of the lakes that form part of the boundary line between the Province of New Brunswick and the State of Maine. The place is about 22 miles from [[Lakeland Ridges]] and about 18 miles from [[Danforth, Maine|Danforth]] and [[Forest Station, Maine|Forest Station]]; the latter two stations being situated on the line of the [[Maine Central Railroad Company]] in the State of Maine.<br />\n<br />\nThe first settler that came to this place was Elias Foster in the year of 1853. When he first came here he lived in a log house on the farm occupied now by W.B. Foster. He lived there about a year and then moved up to the farm occupied now by J.L. Foster. He and his wife and two children lived there for two years with no settlers any nearer than Foster’s Corner -- now called Fosterville, with the exception of two young men who lived here in the summer seasons on the farms occupied now by H.H. Veysey and George McMinn. The next settler that came was William Rollins who lived on the farm occupied now by Whiteford Peck.<br />\n<br />\nAbout three years after the first settler came, other settlers began to come in quite quickly.<br />\n<br />\nIn the year 1863, Henry Pray and George Robinson came here and moved to what is called the Balm of Gilead Point. They lived there for a while when they sold out and other settlers began to come in.<br />\n<br />\nWhen the first settlers came here there were no roads, only sled roads from here to Fosterville. From here to Canterbury there were no roads only a spotted line. After a few years roads were made between here and [[Canterbury Station, New Brunswick|Canterbury Station]].<br />\n<br />\nThe mail came in once a week and it was carried part way by a team and the rest of the way on foot by Samuel Cropley. The North Lake Post Office was located at that time what is now called [[Fosterville, New Brunswick|Fosterville]] and it was kept by William Foster. About the year 1876 it was transferred to Green Mountain and kept by J.R. Foster for about 10 years. It was then transferred to H.H. Veysey where it is kept at the present.</blockquote>\n\nAn article in ''[[The Daily Gleaner]]'', the daily newspaper from Fredericton, author unknown, described Green Mountain as a scenic community with a [[blacksmith shop]] and a couple of stores. [[Logging|Lumbering]] and farming were the main industries. Although the land was extremely rocky, farmers were gradually clearing the land by using [[dynamite]] on the rocks and stumps. Obviously, farming was not the main attraction that drew [[settlers]] to Green Mountain.\n\n==Notable people==\n{{Main|List of people from York County, New Brunswick}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of communities in New Brunswick]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{coord|47.774109|N|67.754015|W|region:CA_type:city|name=Green Mountain|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Communities in York County, New Brunswick]]"

Her father died when she was age 5, and her mother struggled to support her daughter's pursuit of a singing career. At age 18, Sayão made her major opera debut in Rio de Janeiro. Her performance led to an opportunity to study with the famous Elena Teodorini, first in Brazil, then in Romania; and then to study with Polish tenor [[Jean de Reszke]] in Nice. During the mid-1920s and early 1930s, she performed in Rome, Buenos Aires, and Paris as well as in her native Brazil. While at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome, she met impresario Walter Mocchi (1870–1955). After his wife, soprano [[Emma Carelli]], died in 1928, the two became romantically involved and were married. However, it did not last, and in 1935, Sayão married Italian baritone [[Giuseppe Danise]] (1883–1963).\n\nIn 1930, she debuted at the [[Teatro alla Scala]] in Milan, and in the next year, she sang as Juliette in [[Charles Gounod|Gounod]]'s ''[[Roméo et Juliette]]'' at the [[Opéra National de Paris|Paris Opera]]. In the same year, she gained a great success with her debut at the Opéra Comique as [[Lakmé]]. She soon became one of the leading lyric coloratura sopranos in Europe, especially in Italy and France.

There are several hypotheses about the cause of the fire that prompted the final and decisive transfer of population to the mainland. The truth is that the oil industry was an oily layer on the lake, which had the potential to ignite the wooden houses built on stilts in the lake. One hypothesis is the accidental fall of a kerosene lamp to the lake from the Bar Caracas. Another is a fire caused by an oil company when he was going to beat his concession, that company helped reconstruction and retained the award after all, there is no evidence of this fact.<ref>[[:es:Lagunillas de Agua]]</ref>\n\n==Origin of the name==\nCiudad Ojeda was named in honor of [[Alonso de Ojeda]], the Spaniard who was the first European to discover Lake Maracaibo.\n\n==Population==\nCiudad Ojeda is medium-sized among Venezuelan cities, with a population of approximately 130,000 inhabitants. The majority of ''Citojenses'' are of [[Venezuelans|Venezuelan]] origin.

The [[Duke of Sussex]] appointed him Grand Organist of the [[Premier Grand Lodge of England]] in 1812, and he continued in office through the process of Masonic unification in 1813, serving as the first Grand Organist of the [[United Grand Lodge of England]]. He served as Grand Organist for five years, standing down in 1818.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.ugle.org.uk/about-freemasonry/famous-masons |title = Famous Freemasons |publisher=[[United Grand Lodge of England]]|access-date = 10 May 2019 }}</ref>\n\nWesley died in 1837 aged 71, and was buried in [[St Marylebone Parish Church]], an [[Anglican]] church in London.\n\n==Career==\nSamuel showed his musical talent early in life. As a boy, he was recognised as a [[child prodigy]] by the British musical establishment, along with his elder brother, [[Charles Wesley junior|Charles]]. He quickly mastered the [[violin]], harpsichord and organ. By the age of eight, he was becoming known for his composing and improvisational skills. His father, Charles, wrote:\n{{blockquote|He was full eight years old when [[William Boyce (composer)|Dr Boyce]] came to see us and accosted me with, 'Sir, I hear you have an English Mozart in your house.' I called Sam to answer for himself. He had by this time scrawled down his [[Oratorio]] of ''Ruth''. The Doctor looked it over very carefully and seemed highly pleased with the performance. Some of his words were, 'These airs are some of the prettiest I have seen. This boy writes by nature as true a bass as I can do by rule and study.'<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Musical Wesleys|last = Routley|first=Erik|author-link=Erik Routley|publisher = Herbert Jenkins |year = 1968|location = London}}</ref>}}\n\nWesley worked as a [[conductor (music)|conductor]] as well as a music teacher and lecturer. He seems to have been one of the pioneers of the British [[organ recital]]: prior to his time, entertainment was not considered appropriate for a church building. Despite a reputation as the best improviser on the organ in England, he never succeeded in obtaining an organist's post though he applied to the [[Foundling Hospital]] both in 1798 and 1813 and to [[St George's, Hanover Square]] in 1824. Generally he appeared to be mistrusted by the British establishment, perhaps due to a forthright manner, his marriage arrangements and it is possible to speculate that he was unreliable. From 1815 onwards, he was beset by lack of money and depression. At one stage, he was reduced to asking [[Vincent Novello]] for copying work.\n\nHis ability on the organ was so highly regarded that he was introduced to, and played for [[Felix Mendelssohn]] in September 1837, a month before Wesley's death. Mendelssohn gave a recital at [[Christ Church Newgate]], during which Wesley said to his daughter Eliza, \"This is transcendent playing! Do you think I dare venture after this?\" It seems that Mendelssohn persuaded the old man, who was by now very frail, to play. Mendelssohn stood by his side while he was playing and complimented him, but Wesley replied \"Ah, Sir! you have not heard me play; you should have heard me forty years ago.\"<ref>{{Cite book|chapter=Wesley and Mendelssohn in England|title=Samuel Wesley and Dr. Mendelssohn, Three Organ Fugues|type=sheet music|last=Hinrichsen|first=Max|author-link=:de:Max Hinrichsen|publisher=Hinrichsen/[[Edition Peters]]|series=Tallis to Wesley No. 14|id=1744b|year=1962|location=London|pages=2–8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Birchall-Wesley-Horn-Well-Tempered-Clavier.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Title page of first English edition of J.

Originally, it was known as the 2nd New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, but it was redesignated in 1916. The 105th fought as a part of the [[27th Infantry Division (United States)|27th Infantry Division]] during both World Wars, and was highly decorated for its actions during the [[Battle of Saipan]], where its dogged defense against the largest [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[Banzai charge]] of the war decimated its ranks.\n== Spanish–American War ==\nThe 105th Infantry traces its origins to the 2nd New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, first formed in 1898.

[[German Army (German Empire)|German]] [[German spring offensive|offensives]] in the spring of 1918 had penetrated deep into the allied lines, and created [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salients]] near [[Amiens]] and [[Hazebrouck]].

He singlehandedly charged enemy machine-gun positions and led his men through three lines of trenches. He managed to capture a fourth and final trench-line, but was killed when the Germans counterattacked.

Here, during the [[Battle of Makin]], the 3rd Battalion (3-105) made an assault landing alongside the [[165th Infantry Regiment (United States)|165th Infantry Regiment]]. As the landing craft approached the beach, they began to receive small-arms and machine-gun fire from the island's defenders. The assault troops were also surprised to discover that even though they were approaching the beach at high tide as planned, a miscalculation of the lagoon's depth caused their small boats to go aground, forcing them to walk the final 250 yards (230 m) to the beach in waist-deep water. Equipment and weapons were lost or water-soaked, but only three men were killed approaching the beach, mainly because the defenders chose to make their final stand farther inland along the tank barriers. 3-105 fought with the 165th Infantry for the remainder of the battle, which lasted 4 days and cost the Americans 66 killed and 185 wounded. On 24 November 1943, the entire regiment left the atoll for Hawaii, where they arrived on 2 December 1943.\n\n=== Saipan ===\nEarly on 18 June, the regiment assisted the [[165th Infantry Regiment (United States)|165th Infantry Regiment]] with clearing the island's southern airfield, [[Saipan International Airport|Aslito Airfield]], and took up defensive positions that night on the east of the field. On 19 June, 1-105 advanced on Nafutan Point under the command of [[William J. O'Brien (Medal of Honor)|LTC William J. O'Brien]] but became bogged down, and despite armored support and flanking maneuvers, the Japanese position was too strong. 1-105 was unable to breach the Japanese defenses at Nafutan point by 21 June, and were ordered to move north in order to press the advance, and 2-105 was slated with reducing the Nafutan position. At this point of the battle, the three American divisions moved north abreast of each other; the 2nd Marine Division advanced up the west coast, the 4th Marine Division advanced up the east coast, and the 27th Infantry Division advanced up the center of the island.<ref name=\"army.mil\">{{cite web|url=https://history.army.mil/books/wwii/smallunit/smallunit-tanapag.htm|title=Small Unit Actions: The Fight on Tanapag Plain|website=history.army.mil|access-date=2021-11-02|archive-date=2020-11-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201106185452/https://history.army.mil/books/wwii/smallunit/smallunit-tanapag.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> At Nafutan Point, the 1,200 remaining Japanese attacked the 600 men of 2–105, but they were defeated when 3-105 arrived to help, and Nafutan was finally declared secure on 27 June.<ref name=\"historynet.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-saipan|title=Battle Of Saipan|website=HistoryNet|access-date=2021-11-02|archive-date=2021-10-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211018080755/https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-saipan|url-status=live}}</ref> Meanwhile, on 23 June 1944, the units of the 27th Division advanced up what the soldiers called \"Death Valley\" and \"Purple Heart Ridge\" toward [[Mount Tapotchau]].<ref name=\"historynet.com\"/> Elements of the 165th Infantry and 1-105 joined with elements of the [[23rd Marine Regiment (United States)|23rd Marine Regiment]] to capture the villages of Donnay and Hasigoru<ref name=\"historynet.com\"/> from 26 to 27 June.

During the evening and night of 6 July, the Japanese launched minor probing attacks against the 105th's lines to find weak points, and at 0445 on 7 July, they launched the largest Banzai charge of the war; it is estimated over 4,000 Japanese took part in the charge simultaneously.<ref name=\"historynet.com\"/> This charge hit the 105th directly and violently, and the two lead battalions were overrun. [[William J. O'Brien (Medal of Honor)|LTC O'Brien]] led the defense in the 1-105 area, with a pistol in each hand and even manning a nearby [[M2 Browning|.50 Caliber machine-gun]] until he was killed. When his body was found, there were 30 dead Japanese around him, and he received a posthumous [[Medal of Honor]]. When the carnage of the final charge finally ended, 2,295 dead Japanese lay in front of the 105th's positions, and another 2,016 lay intermingled or in the rear of the 105th's positions for a total of 4,311 dead.<ref name=\"historynet.com\"/> US casualties were also heavy, and 1-105 and 2-105 suffered 406 KIA and 512 WIA. In 1–105, Lieutenant John Mulhearn of B Co and Captain Lee G. Brown of C Co were the only surviving officers, and in 2–105, all the company commanders and the entire battalion staff were killed, but the battalion commander (MAJ McCarthy) survived. During the fighting on 7 July, Private [[Thomas Baker (Medal of Honor)|Thomas Baker]] fought with the Japanese although seriously wounded early in the attack, he refused to be evacuated and continued to fight in the close-range battle until running out of ammunition. When a comrade was wounded while trying to carry him to safety, Baker insisted that he be left behind. At his request, his comrades left him propped against a tree and gave him a [[M1911 pistol|pistol]], which had eight bullets remaining. When American forces retook the position, they found the pistol, then empty, and eight dead Japanese soldiers around Baker's body. PVT Baker received a posthumous Medal of Honor. CPT [[Ben L. Salomon]] was the 105th's regimental [[dentist]] officer but on Saipan he was quickly needed as a [[surgeon]]. Salomon's aid station was set up only 50 yards behind the forward foxhole line on 7 July. Fighting was heavy and the Japanese assault soon overran the perimeter, then the aid station. Salomon was able to kill the enemy that entered the hospital tent and ordered the wounded to be evacuated, while he stayed to cover their withdrawal. When an Army team returned to the site days later, Salomon's body was found slumped over a machine gun, with the bodies of 98 enemy troops piled up in front of his position. His body had 76 bullet wounds and many [[bayonet]] wounds, up to 24 of which may have been received while he was still alive. CPT Salomon eventually received the Medal of Honor in 2002, and it is believed that the long delay was due to discriminatory practices arising from Salomon's [[Jewish]] faith. The fighting on 7 July decimated the regiment, and the memory of that night would define the character of the survivors, and set forth a courageous tradition for the future. The badly mauled 105th continued operations on Saipan against an enemy that was all but used up, and the island was eventually declared secure on 9 July 1944.\n\n=== Okinawa ===\nOnce the Battle of Saipan was completed, the 105th Infantry Regiment was assigned to garrison the island from 15 to 30 July. They then moved to [[Espiritu Santo]] for some much needed [[R&R (military)|R&R]] on 4 September.<ref name=\"ny.gov2\">{{cite web|title=105th NY Infantry Regiment during World War Two - NY Military Museum and Veterans Research Center|url=https://dmna.ny.gov/historic/reghist/wwii/infantry/105thInf/105thInfMain.htm|website=dmna.ny.gov|access-date=2021-11-02|archive-date=2020-08-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200819092522/https://dmna.ny.gov/historic/reghist/wwii/infantry/105thInf/105thInfMain.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> The regiment had slowly begun refilling its ranks with replacement officers and men, but were definitely still understrength and weary by the time they departed for [[Okinawa Island|Okinawa]] on 25 March 1945. 3-105 was a little better off than their two sister battalions, so they were selected to assault the island of [[Tsugen Shima]]. In this engagement, on 10 April 1945, the Japanese lost 243 men killed while thirty escaped, and the Americans lost fourteen dead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/battles_okinawa2.html|title=Operation Iceberg: The Assault on Okinawa - Part 2 - The Battle - April - June 1945|website=www.historyofwar.org|access-date=2021-11-02|archive-date=2021-04-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210427084122/http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/battles_okinawa2.html|url-status=live}}</ref> These would be the opening shots of the 105th's involvement in [[Battle of Okinawa|Operation Iceberg]].

Here in southern Okinawa, the 105th was mired in mud, torrential rainfall, and [[static warfare]] reminiscent of the First World War. After pitched fighting across the Shuri Line, the exhausted 27th Infantry Division was relieved by the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]].

Steinbeck wanted to describe the [[Salinas Valley]] for them in detail: the sights, sounds, smells, and colors.\n\n''East of Eden'' brings to life the intricate details of two families, the Trasks and the Hamiltons, and their interwoven stories. The Hamilton family in the novel is said to be based on the real-life family of Samuel Hamilton, Steinbeck's maternal grandfather.<ref>{{cite web |first=Carl|last=Nolte|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2002/02/24/TR16873.DTL |title=In Steinbeck Country | work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=February 24, 2002 |access-date=June 18, 2018}}</ref> A young John Steinbeck also appears briefly in the novel as a minor character.<ref>{{cite book |first=John |last=Steinbeck |author-link=John Steinbeck |title=East of Eden|publisher=Penguin Books |location=London |date=1952 |page=1,496 |isbn=978-0140186390}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe story is primarily set in the Salinas Valley, California, between the beginning of the twentieth century and the end of World War I. The first fourteen chapters, set in [[Connecticut]] and [[Massachusetts]], go as far back as the [[American Civil War]] and serve as backstory for Adam Trask, his brother Charles, their father Cyrus, and [[Cathy Ames]].\n\nIn the beginning of ''East of Eden'', before introducing his characters, Steinbeck carefully establishes the setting with a description of the Salinas Valley in [[Central California]].\n\n===Synopsis===\nAdam Trask – newly wed with newly inherited wealth from his late father – arrives in California and settles with his pregnant wife [[Cathy Ames]] in the Salinas Valley. Without Adam's knowledge, Cathy had tried to [[Unsafe abortion|abort the pregnancy with a knitting needle]]. In their new home, she warns Adam that she had not wanted to move to California and plans to leave as soon as she can. Adam dismisses her, saying \"Nonsense!\"\n\nCathy gives birth to twin boys, shoots Adam in the shoulder after convincing him to unlock the bedroom door, and flees. Adam survives and falls into a deep depression. His [[Chinese-American]] servant, Lee, and his neighbor, the inventive Irish immigrant Samuel Hamilton, rouse Adam out of it enough for him to name his sons [[Aaron]] and [[Caleb]], after biblical characters.\n\nLee becomes a good friend and adopted family member and has long philosophical talks with Adam and Samuel, particularly about the story of [[Cain and Abel]]. Maintaining that it has been imperfectly translated in [[English-language bibles]], Lee tells how his relatives in San Francisco, a group of Chinese scholars, spent two years studying [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] so that they might discover the moral of the Cain and Abel story. Their discovery that the [[Hebrew]] word ''timshel'' means \"thou mayest\", which becomes an important symbol in the novel of a person's [[Free will|power to choose]] their<!-- See [[singular they]] --> paths, meaning that human beings are neither compelled to pursue sainthood nor doomed to sin.\n\nMeanwhile, Cathy becomes a prostitute at the most respectable [[brothel]] in the city of [[Salinas, California|Salinas]]. She renames herself \"Kate Albey\", ingratiates herself with the [[madam (prostitution)|madam]], murders her, and inherits the business. She makes her new brothel infamous as a den of [[sexual sadism]] and a source of [[blackmail]] on the rich and powerful of Salinas Valley.\n\nAdam's sons, Caleb (\"Cal\") and Aaron (\"Aron\") – echoing Cain and Abel – grow up oblivious of their mother's situation. They are opposites: Aron is virtuous and dutiful, Cal wild and rebellious. At an early age, Aron meets a girl, Abra Bacon, from a well-to-do family, and the two fall in love. Although there are rumors around town that Cal and Aron's mother is not dead but is actually still in Salinas, the boys do not yet know that she is Kate.\n\nInspired by Samuel's inventiveness, Adam starts an ill-fated business venture and loses almost all of the family fortune. The boys, particularly Aron, are horrified that their father is now the town's laughingstock and are mocked by their peers for his failure.\n\nAs the boys reach the end of their school days, Cal decides to pursue a career in farming, and Aron goes to college to become an [[Episcopal priest]]. Cal, restless and tortured by guilt about his very human failings, shuns everyone around him and takes to wandering around town late at night. During one of these ramblings, he discovers that his mother is alive and the madam of a brothel. He goes to see her, and she spitefully tells him they are just alike. Cal replies that she is simply afraid and leaves.\n[[File:Salinas_River_Map.jpg|thumb|Map of the [[Salinas Valley]]. The city of [[Salinas, California|Salinas]] is at the north end.]]\nCal goes into business with Samuel's son Will, who is now a successful automobile dealer. Cal's plan is to earn his father's approval and his money back by capitalizing on [[World War I]] and selling beans grown in the Salinas Valley to nations in Europe for a considerable profit. He succeeds beyond his wildest expectations and wraps up a gift of $15,000 in cash which he plans to give to Adam at [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]].\n\nAron returns from [[Stanford University]] for the holiday. There is tension in the air because Aron has not yet told their father that he intends to drop out of college. Rather than let Aron steal the moment, Cal gives Adam the money at dinner, expecting his father to be proud of him. Adam refuses to accept it, however, and tells Cal to give it back to the poor farmers he exploited.\n\nIn a fit of rage and jealousy, Cal takes Aron to see their mother, knowing it will be a shock to him. Sure enough, Aron immediately sees Kate for who she is and recoils from her in disgust. Wracked with self-hatred, Kate signs her estate over to Aron and commits [[suicide]].\n\nAron, his idealistic worldview shattered, enlists in the [[U.S. Army|Army]] to fight in World War I. He is [[killed in action]] in the last year of the war, and Adam suffers a stroke upon hearing the news from Lee. Cal, who began a relationship with Aron's girlfriend Abra after Aron went to war, tries to convince her to run away with him. She instead persuades him to return home.\n\nLee pleads with the bedridden and dying Adam to forgive his only remaining son. Adam responds by non-verbally indicating that he forgives Cal and then says \"timshel,\" giving Cal the choice to break the cycle and conquer sin.\n\n== Characters ==\n* The Trask family: Cyrus Trask, Mrs. Trask, Alice, Adam, Charles, [[Cathy Ames]], Aron, Caleb\n* The Hamilton family: Samuel Hamilton, Liza, George, Will, Tom, Joe, Lizzie, Una, Dessie, Olive, Mollie\n* Other characters: Lee, Abra Bacon, Mr. Edwards, Faye, Ethel, Joe Valery\n\n==Major themes==\nThe book explores themes of depravity, beneficence, love, the struggle for acceptance and greatness, the capacity for self-destruction, and of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and [[free will|freedom]].

It was only upon transcribing the 16 verses of Cain and Abel in the text itself that he enthusiastically took the last three words of the final verse, ''East of Eden'':\n\n\"And Cain went out from the presence of the Lord and dwelt in the land of Nod on the east of Eden.\" (Genesis 4:16)\n\nSteinbeck wrote to a friend after completing his manuscript, \"I finished my book a week ago. [...] Much the longest and surely the most difficult work I have ever done... I have put all the things I have wanted to write all my life. This is 'the book.'

Following the Congress of Lausanne, Hasan Hayri was arrested for wearing Kurdish clothes and for conspiracy against national security and was sentenced to death. He was hanged by Turkish forces following the court decision. Before his death he was asked his last request and said: \"bury my body in the way of Kurdish people, till any Kurd passes from there spitting on my grave.\" He called himself \"Ker Hesen\" (meaning Hasan the donkey, or idiot Hasan) and at the moment of hanging, shouted, \"Uh [[Sheikh Said]], Ker Hesen has been also martyred in the way of Kurdistan!\" Hasan Hayri became a symbol of betrayal among the Kurds.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018|reason=This would look better with a source backing it up}} The Turkish government replaced his grave years after his execution.<ref>[http://www.xakk.net/archives/2246 Who was Ker Hesen?

Following [[World War II]], the square was renamed after [[August Bebel]], a founder of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] in the 19th century.\n\nThe square is located on the south side of the [[Unter den Linden]] boulevard, a major east-west thoroughfare that runs through Berlin's [[city center]]. It consists of a green area to the east and an open area to the west of the [[Berlin State Opera|State Opera]] building, which it surrounds (hence its prewar name). It is bounded to the east by the [[Prinzessinnenpalais]], to the west by the [[Alte Bibliothek]] and the [[Old Palace, Berlin|Old Palace]], and to the southeast by [[St. Hedwig's Cathedral]], the first [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] church built in [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] after the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Plaque at Bebelplaz commemorating Nazi book burning, 10 May 1933.jpg|thumb|left|Plaque at Bebelplaz commemorating Nazi book burning, 10 May 1933]]\n[[File:Opernplatz, Berlin 1880.jpg|thumb|Platz am Opernhaus, {{Circa|1880}}]]\n[[File:Bebelplatz Night of Shame Monument.jpg|thumb|A memorial to the [[Nazi book burnings|Nazi book burning]] by [[Micha Ullman]] set into the Bebelplatz]]\n[[File:Buddy Bear Bebelplatz.jpg|thumb|2006 exhibition of [[United Buddy Bears]]]]\n\n===Early history===\nParts of the fortification of Berlin built in the aftermath of the [[Thirty Years' War]] (the baroque [[Berlin Fortress]]) were later integrated into the boulevard ''[[Unter den Linden]]'' when the fortifications had become useless through the advance of artillery pieces. The site of the fortifications is visible until today as there are no linden trees on this stretch up to the [[Berlin Palace]] on the Spree river island itself. The avenue of trees in the direction of the [[Brandenburg Gate]] begins where it once began outside the fortifications.\n\nThe square, then called ''Platz am Opernhaus'' (i.e. square at the opera house), was laid out between 1741 and 1743 under the rule of King [[Frederick II of Prussia]]. Frederick \"the Great\" had planned a much larger ''Forum Fridericianum'', but his distant cousin, [[Frederick William, Margrave of Brandenburg-Schwedt]], refused to sell his palace, the predecessor of today's [[Old Palace, Berlin|Old Palace]], for the purpose of demolition. So the king felt compelled to take this house, which was in the middle of his plans, into consideration and to scale these down significantly. In return, however, he forced his cousin to give up his garden and some outbuildings, whereupon the [[Berlin State Library|Royal Library]] was built, which is directly adjacent to the back of the margravial house. \n\nThe Opernplatz (today Bebelplatz), which was a bit cramped as a result, has survived almost unchanged: [[Berlin State Opera|State Opera]], [[St. Hedwig's Cathedral]], the ''Old Library Building'' and the ''Palace of [[Prince Henry of Prussia (1726–1802)|Prince Henry]]'', the king's brother, today the main building of [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Humboldt University]], giving the square an almost complete surround of 18th-century buildings. \n\nOn 12 August 1910, it was renamed for Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Francis Joseph I of Austria]] (''Kaiser-Franz-Josef-Platz'') on the occasion of his 80th birthday. The buildings surrounding the square were subsequently largely destroyed in [[World War II]] by [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|air raids]] and the [[Battle of Berlin]]. The ensemble was restored in the 1950s, and the square was renamed on 31 August 1947 as Bebelplatz.\n\n===Nazi book burning===\n{{Main|Nazi book burnings}}\n\nThe Bebelplatz is known as the site of one of the infamous [[Nazi book burnings|Nazi book burning]] ceremonies held in the evening of 10 May 1933 in many German university cities. The book burnings were initiated and hosted by the nationalist [[Deutsche Studentenschaft|German Student Association]], thus stealing a march on the [[National Socialist German Students' League]].  The assembly of the books had started on the sixth, when students dragged the contents of the [[Institut für Sexualwissenschaft | Institute for the Science of Sexuality]] library into the square.  At the Student Association's invitation Propaganda Minister [[Joseph Goebbels]] held an inflammatory speech prior to the burning. Besides other spectators, it was attended by members of the Nazi Students' League, the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] (\"brownshirts\"), [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] and [[Hitler Youth]] groups. They burned around 20,000 books, including works by [[Heinrich Mann]], [[Erich Maria Remarque]], [[Heinrich Heine]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Albert Einstein]] and many other authors. [[Erich Kästner]], whose books were also among those burned, was present at the scene and described it with bitter irony in his diary.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n[[The Empty Library]], a [[Memorial in memory of the burning of books]] by [[Micha Ullman]] consisting of a glass plate set into the cobblestones, gives a view of a group of empty bookcases large enough to hold all 20,000 burned books; its purpose is to commemorate the book burning. Furthermore, a line of [[Heinrich Heine]] from his play, ''[[Almansor]]'' (1821), is engraved on a plaque inset in the square: \"Das war ein Vorspiel nur, dort wo man Bücher verbrennt, verbrennt man am Ende auch Menschen.\" (in English: \"That was only a prelude; where they burn books, they will in the end also burn people\").<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.onejerusalem.com/2008/05/20/where-they-burn-books-they-will-ultimately-also-burn-people/ |title=Where they burn books, they will ultimately also burn people |publisher=Onejerusalem.com |date=May 20, 2008}}</ref> Students at Humboldt University hold a book sale in the square every year to mark the anniversary.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Recent history===\nIn 2006, an exhibition of \"[[United Buddy Bears]]\" was held in the square, for the third time in Berlin. The exhibition consisted of more than 180 bear sculptures, each {{convert|2|m|sp=us}} in height and designed by a different artist. Due to its difficult past the use of Bebelplatz remains disputed, recently sparked off by a wintry skating rink and a party tent of the Berlin [[fashion week]].\n\nIn 2012 several protests were caused by the announced plan of an underground carpark serving the attendees of the opera to be erected under the square and around the subsurface memorial.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Blücher Memorial, Berlin]]\n* [[Bülow Memorial, Berlin]]\n* [[Gneisenau Memorial, Berlin]]\n* [[Scharnhorst Memorial, Berlin]]\n* [[Yorck Memorial, Berlin]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [http://www.stadtpanoramen.de/berlin/bebelplatz.html Panorama Bebelplatz] - Interactive 360° Panorama\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{Coord|52|31|00|N|13|23|38|E|region:DE-BE_type:landmark|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Mitte]]\n[[Category:Rebuilt buildings and structures in Berlin]]\n[[Category:Squares in Berlin]]"

        "content": "{{Short description|Flute partita composed by Johann Sebastian Bach}}\nThe '''Partita in A minor for solo flute''', [[BWV]] 1013,  is a [[partita]] in four movements composed by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]. Its date of composition is uncertain, though on the basis of its advanced playing technique, which is more demanding than in the flute part for the [[Brandenburg concertos#Concerto No. 5 in D major, BWV 1050|Fifth Brandenburg Concerto]], for example, it must have been written after 1723.<ref>Christoph Wolff and Walter Emery, \"Bach, §III: (7) Johann Sebastian Bach\", ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).</ref> The title, however, is the work of 20th-century editors. The title in the only surviving 18th-century manuscript is \"[[Solo (music)|Solo]] p[our une] flûte traversière par J. S. Bach\".\n\n==History==\nThe discoverer of the sole surviving manuscript, [[Karl Straube]], believed it to be an autograph and this view was accepted by [[Alfred Einstein]]. However, more recently it has been shown that it was made by two copyists. Although their names are unknown, one appears to be identical with the principal scribe of another manuscript, P 267 (containing the violin sonatas and partitas, BWV 1001–1006), which places this part of the copy of the Partita in the first half of the 1720s. The other scribe is the one now known as \"Anonymous 5\", an employee of Bach who must have accompanied him when Bach moved from Köthen to Leipzig in 1723. This scribe is known from authentically dated copies of the Cantatas BWV 186 (11 July 1723) and BWV 154 (9 January 1724). On the basis of watermarks and textual criticism, the greater part of the manuscript was probably copied in Leipzig in 1723–1724, while the copyist of the first five lines of the Partita suggest it may have been begun slightly earlier, between 1722 and 1723 in Köthen.<ref>Hans-Peter Schmitz, \"Partita A-moll für Flauto traverso solo, BWV 1013\", in ''Johann Sebastian Bach, Neue Ausgabe sämtlicher Werke'', Serie VI, Band 3 Werke für Flöte: Kritischer Bericht, 7–9 (Kassel, Basel, Paris, London, New York: Bärenreiter, 1963): 7–8.</ref>\n\n==Movements==\n{{listen \n | filename     = Jsbach BWV 1013.ogg\n | title        = Partita in A Minor (BWV 1013)\n | description  = Performed by Alex Murray\n | format1       = [[ogg]] \n | filename2     = Bach - Partita For Solo Flute - Traverso - 1.

She started a charity kitchen (Bhandara) for the needy ones, hence got the name Bhandari Devi. The present site used to be a citadel of the demon called Bhandodari and his clan, who was later killed by Bhandari Devi. Presently Bhandari Devi, through a ritual, is made to visit 'Shiv Pahar', her parents home every third year in a palanquin procession. Anyone can make a wish by offering one or five stone pieces in the temple and on being granted the wish the stones are removed. \nInscriptions of Ashoka period have been recovered from the temple premises. King [[Ashoka]], while on his conquest march is supposed to have taken a night rest here. He liked the peace & tranquility of the place.

He served as an [[altar server]] in his childhood. In 1885 his parents sent him to school at one of the oratories that the [[Salesians of Don Bosco]] managed though he never entertained notions of becoming a priest instead of a [[veterinarian]] as he wished.<ref name=SQPN/><ref name=AT/> He studied there in Valdocco from 1885 to 1889 before deciding to become a Salesian himself.<ref name=EC/> But [[John Bosco|Giovanni Bosco]] also noticed Versiglia's diligence and saw something in him that he wanted to discuss with the child. He told him that he wanted to meet with him soon to tell him important. This happened in 1887 though the actual meeting never took place for Bosco fell ill and died in 1888. Versiglia wondered from that point what it was Bosco wished to speak with him about.<ref name=SEB/>\n\nHe entered the order after [[Michele Rua]] received him into it.<ref name=AT/> He made his solemn profession on 11 October 1889 and he received his [[doctorate]] in philosophical studies from the [[Pontifical Gregorian University|Gregorian]] in [[Rome]] in 1893 (he was there since 1890). His [[ordination]] to the priesthood was celebrated on 21 December 1895 and he was later appointed as [[novice master]] at [[Genzano di Roma|Genzano]] in Rome from 1896 until 1905 where he became known for his strict austerities and discipline.<ref name=CO/><ref name=EC/><ref name=SEB/> But Versiglia needed to receive a special dispensation to be ordained since he was under the canonical age requirement.\n\nHe led the first expedition for Salesian missionaries into [[China]] in 1906 and arrived at [[Macau]] on 7 January.<ref name=SQPN/><ref name=CO/> The priest began his work and established a motherhouse for the order at Macau while opening a new mission in the Shaoguan region where [[Pope Benedict XV]] appointed him as its first apostolic vicar in 1920. Versiglia received his [[episcopal consecration]] in 1921 at the Canton Cathedral where the Salesian [[Servant of God]] [[Carlo Braga]] was stationed at the [[Organ (music)|organ]] for the event. He founded an [[orphanage]] as well as several [[Aged care|aged care homes]] and two [[leper colonies]].<ref name=EC/><ref name=CO/><ref name=SEB/> But he tended to the needs of his people and served in various capacities for them such as their gardener or barber.\n\nHe and Callisto Caravario – fellow Salesian whom he knew well – were travelling at noon on 25 February 1930 via boat along a river to the Lin-Chow mission when [[Bolshevik]] pirates boarded their ship.<ref name=SQPN/> The pirates planned on abducting and enslaving three girls on the ship but the two priest shielded them.<ref name=CO/> But the pirates managed to subdue the pair and knocked them unconscious after striking them with their rifle butts before binding them and going to rummage through their possessions in their luggage. The men discarded the crucifixes as the men came to with the two hearing each other's confession.<ref name=AT/><ref name=SQPN/> The pair were then dragged ashore into a [[thicket]] where Versiglia knew he would die so pleaded for the men to spare Caravario. But the retort came: \"No\" because \"the foreign devils must all die\".<ref name=AT/><ref name=EC/> Five rifle shots ended the pair's lives. Their remains were not discovered until 27 February and the girls captured were released within the week.<ref name=SEB/>\n\nHis remains were interred at the Lin Kong-How Cathedral but the [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] vandalized this place during the [[Cultural Revolution - China|Cultural Revolution]].<ref name=EC/>\n\nOn 2 October 2010 the Salesian cardinal [[Joseph Zen Ze-kiun]] led a torchlight commemoration to the pair on 2 October 2010 to mark a decade since the pair were canonized as saints.<ref name=SEB/>\n\n==Canonization==\nThe process for the pair's canonization opened in both Shaozhou and in [[Turin]] in an informative process that spanned from 31 December 1934 until its closure in 1935. Versiglia's spiritual writings received theological approval on 18 March 1949.<ref name=\"index\">{{cite book |title=Index ac status causarum beatificationis servorum dei et canonizationis beatorum |date=January 1953 |publisher=Typis polyglottis vaticanis |page=10 |language=Latin}}</ref> The formal introduction to the cause came on 13 June 1952 under [[Pope Pius XII]], and he became titled as a [[Servant of God]].<ref name=\"index\" /> There was also a second process that was held but split into two: one was held in [[Hong Kong]] from 1953 to 1954 and the other was held in Turin from 1953 to 1957. Both processes received validation from the [[Congregation for Rites]] on 5 July 1963 when the cause moved to Rome for further investigation.\n\nThe officials from the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] and their consultants approved the cause on 3 February 1976 with the C.C.S. members alone meeting and approving the cause on 11 May 1976. [[Pope Paul VI]] approved their beatification on 13 November 1976 determining that the two were killed \"in odium fidei\" (in hatred of the faith) but died in 1978 before he could celebrate their beatification as did his successor [[Pope John Paul I]] a month later. [[Pope John Paul II]] celebrated the beatification on 15 May 1983.\n\nTheir canonization would have depended on one miracle being attributed to them but this was waivered. Their cause was unified to that of others killed in China on 11 January 2000 with John Paul II signing a decree \"de signis\" on 22 January 2000 which waivered the required miracle for canonization. The date for the celebration was determined at a gathering of cardinals held on 10 March 2000 and Versiglia – and that of 119 others – was canonized as a saint in [[Saint Peter's Square]] on 1 October 2000.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bvers.html Catholic Hierarchy] [[Wikipedia:SPS|{{sup|[''self-published'']}}]]\n* [http://newsaints.faithweb.com/martyrs/China4.htm Hagiography Circle]\n* [http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=7381 Catholic Online]\n\n{{Salesians}}\n{{Portal bar|Saints|Biography|Catholicism|Italy|China}}\n{{Canonization|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Versiglia, Luigi}}\n[[Category:1873 births]]\n[[Category:1930 deaths]]\n[[Category:20th-century Christian saints]]\n[[Category:20th-century Roman Catholic martyrs]]\n[[Category:20th-century venerated Christians]]\n[[Category:Beatifications by Pope John Paul II]]\n[[Category:Canonizations by Pope John Paul II]]\n[[Category:Italian people murdered abroad]]\n[[Category:Italian Roman Catholic missionaries]]\n[[Category:Italian Roman Catholic saints]]\n[[Category:Martyred Roman Catholic bishops]]\n[[Category:Artists from Pavia]]\n[[Category:Pontifical Gregorian University alumni]]\n[[Category:Roman Catholic missionaries in China]]\n[[Category:20th-century Italian Roman Catholic titular bishops]]\n[[Category:Salesian bishops]]\n[[Category:20th-century Roman Catholic bishops in China]]"

The 25-year-old [[rookie]] right-hander stood {{convert|6|ft|1|in|abbr=on}} and weighed {{convert|185|lb|abbr=on}}. Pfund was one of many ballplayers who only appeared in the [[Major League Baseball|major league]]s during [[World War II]]. He made his major league debut in relief against the [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] at the [[Polo Grounds]] on April 21, 1945, when professional baseball teams conducted spring training in the north. His first major league [[Win (baseball)|win]] came in his first start, on May 14, 1945, as the Dodgers defeated the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] 4–1 at [[Ebbets Field]].\n\nSeason and career totals for 15 games include a 3–2 record, 10 [[games started]], 2 [[complete game]]s, 2 [[games finished]], and an [[earned run average|ERA]] of 5.20 in 62.1 [[innings pitched]]. Pfund went 4-for-22 (.182) in batting with a [[double (baseball)|double]] and 2 [[base on balls|walks]], had 4 [[runs batted in]] and scored 2 [[run (baseball)|runs]]. Even though he pitched 62.1 innings in 1945, Pfund tied for ninth among [[National League (baseball)|National League]] hurlers with 5 [[hit batsmen]]. By contrast, it took the other five pitchers who were tied with him for ninth an average of 191.2 innings to hit the same number of batters.

He went on to become the manager of the famous leftist [[Unity Theatre, London]]. \nAs manager of Unity Theatre he staged the first professional British production of a [[Brecht]] play, ''[[The Visions of Simone Machard]]''.

He was adopted by the Lowenstein family after his biological father died of tuberculosis. His biological father was the [[hazzan]] of the city's Orthodox synagogue. As was usual at the time, he was not told by his parents that he was adopted. In March 1932, when Heinz was nine years old, his adoptive father Max Lowenstein committed suicide following the collapse of his business. In 1933 the Nazis came to power in Germany and began persecuting the Jews. Jews were banned from state schools and only one Jewish school, the [[Israelitische Realschule]], in neighbouring [[Fürth]], was allowed to operate (it was closed in 1939<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fuerthwiki.de/wiki/index.php?title=Israelitische_Realschule|title = Israelitische Bürgerschule – FürthWiki}}</ref>) where Heinz attended.<ref>Steven Karras.

In December 1936 Heinz had had his [[bar mitzvah]] in the Orthodox synagogue of Nuremberg where his biological father had been the hazzan.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} In August 1938 [[Julius Streicher]], editor of [[Der Stürmer]], ordered the large Nuremberg Reform Synagogue torn down. In October 1938, during [[Kristallnacht]], the Orthodox synagogue where Heinz had had his [[bar mitzvah]] was burnt down along with most of Germany's synagogues. He hid with relatives in Frankfurt.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nIn August 1938, Poland issued an order depriving Polish Jews residing outside of Poland of their citizenship. Although Heinz was born in Germany and adopted by native German Jews, his real father had emigrated from Poland. In return, Germany began expelling Jews of Polish origin to Poland. The Poles refused to admit them and some 17,000 Jews were trapped between the two countries at [[Zbąszyń]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rijo.homepage.t-online.de/pdf/EN_NU_JU_eastern_jews.pdf|title=Persecuted, murdered, forgotten – Jews from Poland in Nuremberg|website=Rijo.homepage.t-online.de|access-date=27 November 2016}}</ref> At some point the Germans began tracing adopted children of Polish emigrants and in 1939 began proceedings to expel Heinz.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/written-answers/1939/jul/06/refugees|title=REFUGEES|website=[[Hansard|Parliamentary Debates (Hansard)]]|date=6 July 1939|access-date=26 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nJews in Nazi Germany were eligible for one-way passports only, to leave the country; other countries would not admit them due to this. Heinz was ineligible even for this kind of passport as his pre-adoption (biological) father was born in Poland. He was also ineligible for a Polish passport. His mother eventually procured a forged Polish passport for him. In July 1939 the MP [[Josiah Wedgwood, 1st Baron Wedgwood|Josiah Wedgwood]], who dedicated his life to saving Jews, asked a parliamentary question directed at the Home Secretary:<blockquote>\"Colonel Wedgwood asked the Home Secretary whether he will authorise a visa to Frau Betty Loewenstein, [sic] and her son, Heinz, Nurenberg, guarantee and application for whom was made by Walter Block, Alsager, Stoke-on-Trent, on 10th May, in view of the fact that the boy, aged 16 years, is under expulsion orders for 10th July?\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/written-answers/1939/jul/06/refugees|title=REFUGEES|website=[[Hansard|Parliamentary Debates (Hansard)]]|date=6 July 1939|access-date=26 November 2016}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAs a result of this question Heinz and his mother, Betty (maiden name Ehrlich) were granted transit visas to pass through England and join his uncles, who had migrated to the United States. On 28 August 1939, Bernard was sent to England by plane. His mother meant to join him a few days later but on the day she planned to leave Germany, war broke out trapping her on the continent. In mid-1940, she received a U.S. visa and took the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]], travelling through [[Manchukuo|Japanese-occupied China]] to Japan and sailing from there to Seattle. From Seattle she took a bus to Pennsylvania.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jonathanlowenstein.blogspot.com/2010/04/journey-of-lifetime-my-grandmother.html|title=Telaviv1: The Journey of a Lifetime: my grandmother's escape on the Trans-Siberian railway|website=Jonathanlowenstein.blogspot.com|date=26 April 2010|access-date=26 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nHeinz remained trapped in England and learned English by sitting in cinemas watching movies.

At the time television was rare and the travelling theatre provided a major form of local entertainment. In the late 1960s he played the role of the Rabbi in the West End production of ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'' (at Her Majesty's Theatre).<ref name=\"independent1\"/>\n\nFrom 1971 to 1981, Bernard lived in Israel, where he worked at the National Theatre [[Habima]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://habima.millenium.org.il/show_item.asp?itemId=3353&levelId=64383&itemType=0&template=12 |title=Archived copy |access-date=3 June 2017 |archive-date=5 May 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180505070411/http://habima.millenium.org.il/show_item.asp?itemId=3353&levelId=64383&itemType=0&template=12 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and appeared in the educational TV series, Here We Are and Neighbours. The shows aired twice a week on [[Israeli Educational Television]] for 17 years, making him a familiar face to a generation of Israelis and leading to parts in a wide variety of mainstream Israeli cinema.\nIn 1981, he returned to England, where he had to restart his career. He continued to work until his death of a rare blood disease in 1994.

He also wrote studies of both [[Arthur Rimbaud]] and [[Marquis de Sade]]. Along with his artistic partner [[Toyen]] (Marie Čermínová), he became a member of ''[[Devětsil]]'' in 1923, participating in their group exhibitions. He and Toyen also exhibited in Paris in the late 1920s, where they founded their own movement, Artificialism. Between 1928 and 1929 he was designer for the group's drama wing, the ''[[Osvobozené divadlo]]'', where he collaborated with [[Vítězslav Nezval]] and others. Štyrský was also an active editor. In addition to his ''Edition 69'' series, he edited the ''Erotická revue'', which he launched in 1930, and ''Odeon'', where many of his shorter texts appeared. He was a founding member of The [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] Group of [[Czechoslovakia]].\n\n==Important works==\n''Emilie comes to me in a dream'', 1931, published as part of his ''[http://www.twistedspoon.com/edition69.html Edition 69]'' series. ''On the Needles of the Days'', 1941, photographic series in collaboration with Jindřich Heisler who provided the text.\n\n==Life==\nŠtyrský was born on 11 August 1899 in [[Dolní Čermná]] (that time called Čermná u Kyšperka), where he spent his childhood. The death of his half-sister in 1905, with whom he had a very strong relationship, greatly affected his later life and artistic creation. He studied first in [[Hradec Králové]], then the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Prague]]. He was very active in the art world, was a member of Devětsil beginning in 1923, and in the years 1932–1942 was a member of the Fine Artists Association. His early artistic work was partly under the influence of [[Cubism]], but he later became a surrealist.\n\nDuring the summer in 1922, he met Marie Čermínová (1902–1980), who later began using the pseudonym [[Toyen]]. They worked closely as an artistic pair. In [[Prague]] in 1923, they became members of the Devětsil group. Later, in Paris, they established their own two-person movement, Artificialism, which their associate Karel Teige linked to his own Poetism. After returning to Prague he became designer for the [[Liberated Theatre]].\n\nIn 1934, with Toyen, Bohuslav Brouk, Vítězslav Nezval, and others, he co-founded the Surrealist Group of Czechoslovakia in Prague. At the invitation of the Parisian Surrealists in 1935 he returned again to Paris. There Štyrský became seriously ill, probably the same heart condition as his sister. He recovered during his stay, though only temporarily.\n\nHe died on 21 March 1942 in Prague of pneumonia.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.twistedspoon.com/styrsky.html Short biography] (free use)\n*[http://www.schaden.com/book/StyJin01472.html Book on Štyrský]\n*[http://www.twistedspoon.com/edition69.html ''Edition 69''] (in English)\n*[http://www.twistedspoon.com/dreamverse.html ''Dreamverse''] (in English)\n*[http://cafeirreal.alicewhittenburg.com/review4b.htm Glimmers of irreality: the photographs of Jindrich Štyrský] (essay about Štyrský in ''irreal (re)views'')\n*[https://www.fostinum.org/czech-photomontage.html Fostinum: Czech Photomontage -- Several examples of Jindřich Štyrský's work]\n\n{{Surrealism}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Styrsky, Jindrich}}\n[[Category:1899 births]]\n[[Category:1942 deaths]]\n[[Category:Czech male writers]]\n[[Category:Czech photographers]]\n[[Category:Czech surrealist artists]]\n[[Category:20th-century Czech painters]]\n[[Category:Czech male painters]]\n[[Category:People from Ústí nad Orlicí District]]\n[[Category:Deaths from pneumonia in Czechoslovakia]]\n[[Category:20th-century Czech male artists]]\n[[Category:Deaths from pneumonia in the Czech Republic]]"

The channel was owned by [[Viacom International Media Networks]] and was originally a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] channel. Formed after the two other [[The Music Factory|TMF station]]s, which were based in mainland [[Europe]], the channel was created to counter against [[EMAP]]'s [[The Hits]] channel (now [[4Music]]) on the new [[free-to-air]] digital terrestrial television service [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] in 2002. The channel ceased broadcasting on 26 October 2009.\n\nUpon launch, TMF's description was \"''TMF is designed to replicate the rhythms of the whole family, playing the best pop videos with the biggest pop stars to become the sound track to the British family life.''\" However, it later broadened its content to air programming from its sister channels [[MTV (UK and Ireland)|MTV]], [[VH1 (UK and Ireland)|VH1]], [[Nick Jr. (British and Irish TV channel)|Nick Jr.]], [[Nickelodeon (British and Irish TV channel)|Nick]], and [[Comedy Central (UK and Ireland)|Comedy Central]], so it no longer relied on just music videos.\n\nTMF broadcast on [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]], [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky]] and [[Virgin Media]] and as well as in some [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] cable packages. The channel was the most viewed music video related station in the UK, according to [[BARB]] ratings.\n\n==Shows on TMF==\n\n===MTV/VH1 programming===\nTMF initially launched as a non-stop music channel, though from early 2004 it began to air programming from MTV and VH1:\n\n* ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]''\n* ''[[Date My Mom]]''\n* ''[[Dirty Sanchez (TV series)|Dirty Sanchez]]''\n* ''[[Drawn Together]]''\n* ''[[The Fabulous Life of...]]''\n* ''[[Hogan Knows Best]]''\n* ''[[Jackass (franchise)|Jackass]]''\n* ''[[Made (TV series)|Made]]''\n* ''[[MTV Cribs]]''\n* ''[[My Fair Brady]]''\n* ''[[My Super Sweet 16]]''\n* ''[[Pimp My Ride]]''\n* ''[[Room Raiders]]''\n* ''[[The Surreal Life]]''\n\n===Noggin===\n'''Noggin''' started broadcasting on 30 January 2006, the first international feed of Noggin (excluding the former vintage block on Nick Jr. which only had the name in common). It was a [[Children's television series|children's television]] slot broadcast on TMF from 07:00 to 09:00 daily. It showed a selection of Nick Jr shows and often promoted the full Nick Jr. channels to viewers with only Freeview. It was hosted by Moose A. Moose and Zee D. Bird from the American [[Noggin (brand)|Noggin]].\n\nIt was relaunched in 2009 after replacing the former '''Nick Jr. on TMF''' block.  The final set of programmes shown were [[Go Diego Go!]], [[Dora the Explorer (TV series)|Dora the Explorer]], [[Little Bear (TV series)|Little Bear]], [[Bruno (TV series)|Bruno]] and [[Maggie and the Ferocious Beast]].\n\nNoggin was the first commercial children's television channel launched on 30 January 2006 on TMF to air on the UK's [[Digital terrestrial television|DTT]] platform, [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]], followed by [[CITV]], then lastly [[Disney Junior (UK & Ireland)|Playhouse Disney]] on [[ABC1 (UK)|ABC1]].\n\nFollowing the closure of TMF, the block continued on [[Viva (British and Irish TV channel)|Viva]] until March 2010, when the Nick Jr. rebrand caused Noggin to shutdown. However, the branding of Noggin (except the name \"Noggin\") and the Moose and Zee segments were adopted by Nick Jr. and used until January 2013.\n\n===Nick Jr on TMF===\n'''Nick Jr on TMF''' had replaced the strand Noggin on 25 September 2006, but its programming remained identical. It is unknown why the rebrand happened, or why it reverted to Noggin in 2009. It used the same [[Station identification|ident]] and presentation package as its main sister channel, [[Nick Jr. (UK & Ireland)|Nick Jr]]. Moose and Zee's segments were removed as well. Programmes shown included ''[[Peppa Pig]]'', ''[[Maggie and the Ferocious Beast]]'', ''[[Dora the Explorer (TV series)|Dora the Explorer]]'', ''[[The Backyardigans]]'', ''[[Thomas & Friends]]'', ''[[Blue's Clues]]'', ''[[LazyTown]]'', ''[[Go Diego Go!]]'', ''[[Little Bill]]'' amongst others.\n\n===Nickelodeon programming===\nRepeat airings of ''[[Nickelodeons UK Kids Choice Awards 2008]]'' were scheduled on TMF and [[MTV Hits (UK & Ireland)|MTV Hits]], in September 2008.<ref>Daniel Kilkelly.

Retrieved 2 September 2008.</ref>\n\nTMF had also aired ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' for a brief time in 2004 in late night hours.\n\n===Comedy Central programming===\nIn January 2007 TMF began showing comedies broadcast on [[Comedy Central (UK and Ireland)|Paramount Comedy]], in a strand entitled '''Comedy Classics'''. These included the likes of ''[[The Wonder Years]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]]'' and ''[[Cheers]]'', as well as various [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount films]]. During ''The Friday Movie'' strand, the channel's [[Digital on-screen graphic|DOG]] changed to an enlarged version, with a re-arranged name displaying \"TFM\".\n\n=== Original programming ===\nIn August 2005, TMF commissioned two new shows called ''Pop the Q'' and ''Game One''. In early 2006 came ''The Loaded Hour'' (a male-orientated themed show named after the magazine sponsor, fronted by [[Kate Edmondson]]), and in the summer a new live show called ''TMF Live'' (presented again by Edmondson, as well as TMF News anchor [[Carole Machin]]). With the exception of ''Pop the Q'', none of the shows had a second series.\n\n==Replacement and closure==\n\nOn 14 October 2009, MTV Networks announced plans to replace TMF with a new music and comedy channel. [[Viva (UK and Ireland)|Viva]] replaced TMF on 26 October 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/oct/16/mtv-viva-uk|title=MTV replaces TMF with Viva|access-date=16 October 2009 | work=The Guardian | location=London | first=John | last=Plunkett | date=16 October 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.viva.tv/|title=Viva|access-date=14 October 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agbnielsen.co.uk/agb/files/ClientServices/New%20BARB%20Channels/Rebranding%20-%20TMF.doc|title=TMF|access-date=14 October 2009}}</ref>\nThe final music video that was shown on TMF was [[Whitney Houston|Whitney Houston's]] \"[[Million Dollar Bill]]\" at around 5:55 am on 26 October 2009.

That year, Wang Chongrong was assassinated by his officer Chang Xingru ({{lang|zh|常行儒}}). Shortly after the assassination, then-reigning [[Emperor Xizong of Tang|Emperor Xizong]] made Wang Chongying the military governor of Huguo and Wang Gong the acting military governor of Shanguo, keeping both circuits in the hands of the Wang family.<ref name=ZZTJ257>''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷257|vol. 257]].</ref>\n\n== As military governor of Baoyi ==\nWang Chongying died in 895. Wang Gong, who was referred to by that point as the military governor of Baoyi (as Shanguo had been renamed to Baoyi), coveted Huguo. However, the Huguo soldiers supported his cousin [[Wang Ke (Tang dynasty)|Wang Ke]]—a biological son of his uncle Wang Chongjian ({{lang|zh|王重簡}}) who had been adopted as a son by Wang Chongrong—to succeed Wang Chongying. Both Wang Gong and his brother Wang Yao ({{lang|zh|王瑤}}) the prefect of Jiang Prefecture (絳州, in modern Yuncheng) objected and attacked Wang Ke. They also wrote the major warlord [[Zhu Wen|Zhu Quanzhong]] the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (宣武, headquartered in modern [[Kaifeng]], [[Henan]]), claiming that Wang Ke was not actually biologically a member of the Wang family, while Wang Ke's father-in-law [[Li Keyong]] the military governor of Hedong Circuit (河東, headquartered in modern [[Taiyuan]], [[Shanxi]]), who was the main rival to Zhu, supported Wang Ke.<ref name=ZZTJ260>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷260|vol. 260]].</ref>\n\nThen-reigning [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong]] (Emperor Xizong's brother and successor) tried to send imperial [[eunuch (court official)|eunuch]]s to mediate, but the mediation was not successful. Wang Gong and Wang Yao, unable to prevail over Wang Ke, then requested that Emperor Zhaozong send an alternative military governor for Huguo, and Emperor Zhaozong initially commissioned the [[chancellor of the Tang dynasty|chancellor]] [[Cui Yin]] to be the military governor of Huguo. However, at Li Keyong's insistence, Emperor Zhaozong then commissioned Wang Ke as military governor of Huguo. When Wang Gong subsequently sent gifts to and persuaded three other warlords — [[Wang Xingyu]] the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (靜難, headquartered in modern [[Xianyang]], [[Shaanxi]]), [[Li Maozhen]] the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (鳳翔, headquartered in modern [[Baoji]], [[Shaanxi]]), and [[Han Jian (Zhenguo warlord)|Han Jian]] the military governor of Zhenguo Circuit (鎮國, headquartered in modern [[Weinan]], [[Shaanxi]]) — to propose an alternative, that Wang Gong be given Huguo and Wang Ke be given Baoyi instead, Emperor Zhaozong rejected the proposal based on the fact that he had already granted Li Keyong's request. Subsequently, Wang Xingyu, Li Maozhen, and Han, embarrassed that their request was rejected, marched on to the capital [[Chang'an]] to threaten Emperor Zhaozong, and while they were there, they executed two former chancellors whom they perceived to be against them, [[Wei Zhaodu]] and [[Li Xi (Tang dynasty)|Li Xi]]. Under duress, Emperor Zhaozong was forced to issue an edict making Wang Gong the military governor of Huguo, Wang Xingyu's brother Wang Xingyue ({{lang|zh|王行約}}) the military governor of Baoyi, and Wang Ke the military governor of Kuangguo Circuit (匡國, also in modern Weinan, which Wang Xingyue had governed).<ref name=ZZTJ260/>\n\nThe three warlords' actions drew a serious reaction from Li Keyong, who marched south from Hedong and prepared to attack them. When Li Keyong reached Jiang Prefecture, Wang Yao resisted him. Li Keyong quickly defeated and executed Wang Yao, and then marched on to the capital, eventually defeating Wang Xingyu, who fled but was killed in flight, and forcing Li Maozhen and Han into (temporary) submission to Emperor Zhaozong. In the aftermaths of this war, Wang Gong appeared to escape major repercussions, but was also unable to achieve his goal of taking over Huguo; rather, he remained at Baoyi.<ref name=ZZTJ260/>\n\nIn 897, Wang Gong launched another attack on Huguo, and this time he had the assistance from Zhu's generals Zhang Cunjing ({{lang|zh-hant|張存敬}}) and [[Yang Shihou]]. They initially defeated Wang Ke just south of Yishi (猗氏, in modern Yuncheng), but Li Keyong's nephew [[Li Sizhao]] then defeated them, forcing them to stop the siege against Huguo. In 898, Baoyi and Xuanwu forces against attacked Huguo, and Li Keyong again sent Li Sizhao to help Wang Ke repel the attack.<ref name=ZZTJ261>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷261|vol. 261]].</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Wang Gong's rule of Baoyi was said to be violent, and imperial officials who went through Baoyi and who managed to offend him somehow where often arrested and killed.<ref name=NBT187>''[[New Book of Tang]]'', [[:zh:s:新唐書/卷187|vol. 187]].</ref> For example, in 898, when Emperor Zhaozong summoned the retired official Wang Zhu ({{lang|zh|王柷}}) to Chang'an, it was commonly speculated that Wang Zhu would next be made a chancellor. When Wang Zhu went through Baoyi on his way to Chang'an, Wang Gong initially accorded him great honor and wanted to meet him under ceremony that would make Wang Gong be like a son or nephew to him. When Wang Zhu refused, Wang Gong, in anger, killed Wang Zhu and his families and threw their bodies into the Yellow River, and then claimed to the imperial government that they had drowned when their ship capsized. The seriously weakened imperial government did not dare to investigate. By 899, it was said that Wang Gong had become so violent and paranoid that not even his wife and children could be secure that they could escape his wrath. Thereafter, he was killed in a mutiny, and the soldiers supported the officer Li Fan ({{lang|zh|李璠}}) to succeed him. Several months later, Li Fan was himself killed in a mutiny, and the officer [[Zhu Youqian|Zhu Jian]] took over.<ref name=ZZTJ261/>\n\n== Notes and references ==\n<references/>\n* ''[[Old Book of Tang]]'', [[:zh:s:舊唐書/卷182|vol. 182]].\n* ''[[New Book of Tang]]'', [[:zh:s:新唐書/卷187|vol. 187]].\n* ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', vols.

The trust had initially intended to open the school as a [[Free school (England)|free school]] but was put off due to the \"very restrictive\" admissions policy that would have stopped them from reserving places for Catholics.

By 1937, it became a [[Nursing home care|nursing home]] for army officers and used as St Margaret's School for disabled children between 1946 and 1985.

This connection may be through citizenship, descent or cultural. For most Venezuelans, many or all of these connections exist and are the source of their Venezuelan citizenship or their bond to Venezuela.   \n\nIn recent years, after mass emigrations, the term \"'''''Venzies'''''\" has emerged as a playful and affectionate nickname for Venezuelan men, while \"'''''Venuzzies'''''\" is sometimes used to refer to Venezuelan women, drawing inspiration from the Roman goddess Venus to emphasize elegance and femininity. These terms parallel other friendly demonyms like “Aussies” for Australians or “Kiwis” for New Zealanders, reflecting a trend of using lighthearted names to show warmth and familiarity. They add a modern and friendly twist to Venezuelan identity, being introduced by local communities in english speaking countries as they welcome newcomers from Venezuela.   \n\nVenezuela is a [[Multiculturalism|diverse]] and [[Multilingualism|multilingual]] country, home to a melting pot of people of distinct origins, as a result, many Venezuelans do not regard their nationality with ethnicity, but with citizenship or allegiance. Venezuela as Argentina and Brazil, received most immigrants, during 1820s to 1930s Venezuela received a major wave of 2.1 million European immigrants, being the third country in Latin America to have received Europeans, behind Argentina and Brazil.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Baily|first1=Samuel L.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NZQxkfvMJFgC&pg=PA14|title=Mass Migration to Modern Latin America|last2=Míguez|first2=Eduardo José|date=2003|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8420-2831-8|language=en|access-date=26 October 2021|archive-date=15 April 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240415222536/https://books.google.com/books?id=NZQxkfvMJFgC&pg=PA14#v=onepage&q&f=false|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Historical and ethnic aspects==\n\n===Pre-Columbian period===\n\nWriting was not used in pre-Columbian times, a historical stage where various groups began to move throughout the Americas, thus making it difficult to find evidence of the people who began to populate this land. However, archaeological excavations show evidence of certain periods that were taking place on the continent.\n\nVenezuela was probably first settled by humans 16,000 years ago, due to migration flows from other indigenous cultures of America, from the south to the Amazon, from the west through Los Andes and north by the [[Caribbean Sea]].\n\nThere are four periods of diversity that develop in the current Venezuela, which also entering a new period, it did not mean the end of the previous. \n\nThe first migrations to the continent were probably from East Asia to 15,000 years. C. These early migrants (called forth by the generic name \"Indians\") came at first to be located in North America, later moving to the territory of present Venezuela.\n\nDuring this period, various mammals were disappearing by climatic changes already beginning to take place from 5000 years ago, so the population in the mainland, starts to move towards the coast and spread to some nearby islands, trying to find new feeding alternatives.\n\n===Colonization===\nOn August 2, 1498 (516 years), [[Christopher Columbus]], and the Spanish colonizers' ships, first landed on the American mainland in what is currently Venezuelan territory. Colonization was rapid despite small local indigenous rebellions, and the Spaniards manage to conquer the territory. During this period, the most significant crossbreeding process took place. One that will later define the social profile of the country.\n\nWith the passage of time, and the introduction of the African continent, a third race, the Africans, started to integrate into the population, creating heterogeneity in the faces of the society of the time.\n\nDuring colonial centuries in Venezuela began to settle the \"peninsular whites\", coming directly from the Iberian Peninsula and which were those who held positions in the crown, representing only 15% of the population. Another group of whites who were born in Venezuela were originally called \"Creole\", representing 20% of the population: they were mostly from the Canary Islands and they worked mainly in petty trade. The other two smaller groups were the original inhabitants and indigenous blacks brought from Africa: they were about 5% of the population. Soon the original groups started to have interbreedings and this created a process of \"fusion\" between the different racial groups: The \"brown\" were descendants of the unions between Whites, Indians and Blacks and by the 18th century were the largest racial and social group being more than 60% of the population.\n\nThis process is currently responsible for the majority of Venezuelans who are of mixed race. This number, however, would continue to decrease after the economic boom in the mid 20th century.\n\n===Current ethnic groups===\n\nThe country has a diverse population that reflects its rich history and the people that have lived here since antiquity to the present. The historic amalgam of different principal groups form the basis of the current demographics of Venezuela: the European immigrants, the Amerindian peoples, African, and other recent immigrants.\n\nMany of the indigenous peoples were absorbed by the mixed population, but the remaining 500,000 currently represent more than 85 different cultures.\n\nEuropean immigrants were mainly Spanish colonists, but another large and growing number are descendants of Europeans ([[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], [[Italo-Venezuelans|Italians]], [[Germans]] and [[Americans]]) who migrated to the region in mid-twentieth century during the oil growth in the country. Small numbers are descendants of [[French people|French]], [[English people|English]] and [[Polish people|Polish]], as they emigrated during World War II and the Cold War.\n\nBlack Africans were brought as slaves, mostly coastal lowlands, beginning early in the sixteenth century and continuing into the nineteenth century. Other immigrant populations are Asian and Middle East, particularly Lebanon, Syria and the Arab world, some Jews from southern Spain, Israel and Central European nations,  Dominicans, Trinidadians and Tobagonians, Haitians, Cubans, Peruvians, Argentines, Uruguayans, Chileans, Ecuadorians, Guyaneses and Colombians, this being the greatest social impact due to a large number of displaced individuals who entered the Venezuelan territory during the armed conflict in that country; which generated a high supply of labor, personnel and domestic economy informal.\n\n===Ethnic-somatic characteristics===\n[[File:Venezolanos in Bois de Boulogne Park, Québec, Cánada.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Venezuelan people in [[Canada]].]]\n[[File:Boys_in_the_river_of_Venezuela_2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Boys from [[Margarita Island]], [[Nueva Esparta]].]]\nAs of 1981, according to the critic D'Ambrosio and other academics, about 51.6% of Venezuelans are mestizos or mulattos (called ''Criollos'': the 40% of them are with mostly white features, 20% with mostly black features and 10% with mostly Indians features), 45% are white, 2% are black and 1% Indians. According to these scholars, is the fact that virtually there are no pure blacks nor indigenous people in Venezuela. With the exception of direct descendants of immigrants or specific indigenous tribes.\n\nIn addition, according to a genetic autosomal DNA study conducted in 2008 by the University of Brasilia (UNB), the composition of the population of Venezuela is: 60.60% European, 23% of Native American contribution and 16% of Africa's contribution.<ref name=\"Godinho 2008\">{{cite web|last=Godinho|first=Neide Maria de Oliveira|title=O impacto das migrações na constituição genética de populações latino-americanas|url=http://repositorio.unb.br/handle/10482/5542|publisher=Universidade de Brasília|access-date=1 August 2012|year=2008|archive-date=16 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316152334/https://repositorio.unb.br/handle/10482/5542|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Demography==\n{{Main|Demographics of Venezuela}}\n[[Image:Protests opposing Bolivarian Revolution in São Paulo, Brazil 12.jpg|220px|thumb|left|Venezuelans in a protest against the [[Bolivarian Revolution]] in [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]].]]\n[[Image:Venezuelan people in the world.svg|300px|right|thumb|Venezuelan diaspora in the world<br />{{Legend|#000000|Venezuela}}\n{{Legend|#7d0d1aff|+ 1,000,000}}\n{{Legend|#cf142bff|+ 100,000}}\n{{Legend|#f88290ff|+ 10,000}}\n{{Legend|#fac7caff|+ 1,000}}]]\nThe population of approximately 28 million people (in 2011) <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ine.gob.ve/documentos/Demografia/CensodePoblacionyVivienda/pdf/ResultadosBasicosCenso2011.pdf|title=Ine.gob.ve|access-date=10 March 2016|archive-date=2 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002105529/http://www.ine.gob.ve/documentos/Demografia/CensodePoblacionyVivienda/pdf/ResultadosBasicosCenso2011.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>\nmade Venezuela the sixth-most populous country in [[Latin America]] (after [[Brazil]], [[Mexico]], [[Colombia]], [[Argentina]] and [[Peru]]).

The literacy rate (98 percent) in Venezuela is also well above the world average, and the rate of population growth slightly exceeds the world average.

She is also the [[2020 Skate America]] gold medalist, [[2016 Skate America]] silver medalist, the 2019 [[Internationaux de France]] bronze medalist, the [[2019 Rostelecom Cup]] bronze medalist, the [[2019 CS Nebelhorn Trophy]] champion, and the [[2016 CS U.S. International Figure Skating Classic|2016 CS U.S. International Classic]] silver medalist.\n\nBell finished within the top six at four [[ISU Figure Skating Championships|ISU Championships]], with her best result being fourth place at the [[2022 World Figure Skating Championships]] and represented the United States at the [[2022 Winter Olympics]].\n\n== Personal life ==\nMariah Bell was born on April 18, 1996, in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]].<ref name=ISU-1617/> She is the second child of Kendra and Andy Bell.<ref name=USFS-MB/> Her older sister, Morgan, has skated with Disney on Ice.<ref name=Omaha130124/><ref name=TSL150322/>\n\nAt age 12, Bell moved with her mother and sister from [[Houston]] to [[Westminster, Colorado]].<ref name=DP170124/> She graduated from [[Ralston Valley High School]] in 2014,<ref name=DP170124/> and was named the school's Super Senior.<ref name=USFS-MB/>\n\n== Career ==\n=== Early years ===\nBell began skating at the age of four because of her sister.<ref name=Omaha130124/> Early in her career; she was coached by Megan Faulkner, Billy Schneider, and Candy Brown.<ref name=ISU-1314/><ref name=USFS-MB/> At age 12, she joined Cindy Sullivan in [[Westminster, Colorado]].<ref name=DP170124/>\n\nBell finished fifth in the junior division at the [[2012 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|2012 U.S. Championships]].<ref name=USNational12/> She was assigned to the [[Gardena Spring Trophy|2012 Gardena Spring Trophy]] and won the junior silver medal.<ref name=Gardena12/>\n\nBell won the silver medal in the junior division of the [[2013 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|2013 U.S. Championships]], behind [[Polina Edmunds]].<ref name=GS130124/>\n\n=== 2013–14 season ===\nDuring the 2013–14 season, Bell was coached by Cindy Sullivan in [[Westminster, Colorado]].<ref name=ISU-1314/> Making her [[ISU Junior Grand Prix]] debut, she won a bronze medal in [[ISU Junior Grand Prix in Mexico|Mexico]]<ref name=JGP13Mexico/> and finished seventh in [[ISU Junior Grand Prix in Poland|Poland]].<ref name=JGP13Baltic/> At the [[2014 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|2014 U.S. Championships]], Bell finished thirteenth.<ref name=USNational14/> Soon after her high school graduation in 2014, she moved to [[Monument, Colorado]] so that she could train under Kori Ade.<ref name=TSL150322/>\n\n=== 2014–15 season ===\nBell's senior international debut came in the 2014–15 season. She competed at two [[ISU Challenger Series]] events, the [[2014 Nebelhorn Trophy]] where she finished fifth,<ref name=Nebelhorn14/> and the [[Golden Spin of Zagreb|2014 Golden Spin of Zagreb]] where she placed eighth.<ref name=GoldenSpin14/> She finished sixth at the [[2015 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|2015 U.S. Championships]], having ranked twelfth in the short program and 6th in the free skate.\n\n=== 2015–16 season ===\nIn 2015–16, Bell started her season on the [[ISU Challenger Series]] (CS), placing sixth at the [[2015 CS U.S. International Figure Skating Classic|2015 U.S. International Classic]] and 13th at the [[2015 Ondrej Nepela Trophy]].\n\nMaking her [[ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating|Grand Prix]] debut, Bell finished 8th at [[2015 Skate America]], scoring personal bests in the free skate and combined total score. She placed eleventh at the [[2016 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|2016 U.S. Championships]].\n\n=== 2016–17 season ===\n[[File:Skate America 2016 Ladies (cropped).jpg|thumb|260px|right|Bell at the [[2016 Skate America]] medal ceremony]]\nBell changed coaches in August 2016, joining [[Rafael Arutyunyan]] in [[Lakewood, California]].<ref name=IN160917/><ref name=IN161116/> She landed on the podium at two of her [[2016–17 ISU Challenger Series]] assignments. Ranked second in both segments, she took silver at the [[2016 CS U.S. International Figure Skating Classic|2016 CS U.S. International Classic]], behind [[Satoko Miyahara]]. At the [[2016 CS Ondrej Nepela Memorial]], she placed fifth in the short, fourth in the free, and third overall behind [[Maria Sotskova]] and [[Yulia Lipnitskaya]]. She was invited to the [[2016 Skate America]] to replace the injured [[Angela Wang]].<ref name=USFS161012/> She won the silver medal behind [[Ashley Wagner]] after placing sixth in the short program and first in the free skate.\n\nIn January 2017, Bell received the bronze medal at the [[2017 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|U.S. Championships]], earning her a spot on the Four Continents and World teams. In February, she placed sixth at the [[2017 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|2017 Four Continents Championships]] in [[Gangneung]], South Korea. She later placed twelfth at her first trip to the [[2017 World Figure Skating Championships|2017 World Championships]] in [[Helsinki]], Finland.\n\n=== 2017–18 season ===\nBell began her season placing fifth at the [[2017 CS U.S. International Figure Skating Classic|U.S. International Figure Skating Classic]] behind teammates [[Mirai Nagasu]] and [[Karen Chen]] and was assigned to the [[Cup of Russia|Rostelecom Cup]] and the [[2017 NHK Trophy|NHK Trophy]] on the [[2017–18 ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating]] circuit.\n\nAfter a sixth-place finish at the [[2017 Rostelecom Cup]], Bell placed ninth at the [[2017 NHK Trophy]].\n\nBell was named as the second alternate to the [[2018 Winter Olympics]] team after placing fifth at the [[2018 U.S. Figure Skating Championships]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]].  On the withdrawal of [[Karen Chen]], she was named to the [[2018 World Figure Skating Championships]] team and placed twelfth.\n\n=== 2018–19 season ===\nBell began the season at [[2018 CS Nebelhorn Trophy]], where she placed fourth overall with a score of 188.97. She was invited to [[2018 Skate Canada International]], where she placed fourth with a score of 190.25. In November, at [[2018 NHK Trophy]], she placed fifth overall with a score of 198.96, the highest in her career. She won the bronze medal at the [[2018 CS Golden Spin of Zagreb|2018 CS Golden Spin]] after placing fourth in the short program and third in the free program, earning 196.60 points.\n\nAt the [[2019 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|2019 U.S. Championships]], Bell underrotated the second part of her combination and placed third in the short program, behind [[Bradie Tennell]] and [[Alysa Liu]].<ref name=GS190125/>  She placed second in the free skate, behind Liu, winning the bronze medal overall, the second of her career.  Because the 13-year-old Liu was ineligible for senior (or even junior) international competition, Bell joined silver medalist Tennell on the American team for the [[2019 World Figure Skating Championships|2019 World Championships]], as well as the [[2019 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|2019 Four Continents Championships]].<ref name=GS190126/>\n\nBell placed third in the short program at Four Continents, setting a new personal best and winning a bronze small medal.<ref name=GS190207/>  The free skate proved to be less successful, with a fall on a triple loop jump and a doubled Lutz, and she fell to sixth overall.<ref name=GS190209/>\n\nBell finished ninth at the [[2019 World Figure Skating Championships]] with a career-best total score of 208.07.<ref name=GS190322/> Bell's attendance at the World Championships became enmeshed in controversy when she was accused of deliberately causing an on-ice incident in which the blade of her free leg hit South Korean skater [[Lim Eun-soo]] during a practice session, causing a cut on Lim's calf.<ref name=WP190321/>  Lim's agency, All That Sports, stated to Agence-France Presse that the incident had been intentional and part of a pattern of bullying by Bell.<ref name=TI190322/>  Upon request from the Korean Skating Federation, the International Skating Union conducted an investigation. On March 21, the ISU stated that it found no evidence that Bell had sought to injure Lim intentionally.<ref name=CBC190321/>  [[Rafael Arutyunyan]], who coached both Bell and Lim, denied the allegations:  \"The thing is that Mariah’s program includes an element where she lays her leg back and stretches it. This is how it happened that she touched Lim’s leg with her blade. Of course, it was not deliberately! There has never been any confrontation between them at training sessions.\"<ref name=RT454396/> Bell later said: \"The whole experience was really bizarre, and it just felt like I was drowning in this nightmare of completely false information that was put out there that I couldn't do anything about.\"<ref name=EOI200119/>\n\nBell concluded her season as part of the gold medal-winning Team USA at the [[2019 ISU World Team Trophy in Figure Skating|2019 World Team Trophy]].<ref name=GS190413/>\n\n=== 2019–20 season ===\n[[File:2019 Internationaux de France Saturday medals ladies 8D9A2656.jpg|thumb|260px|right|Bell (right) with [[Alina Zagitova]] (left) and [[Alena Kostornaia]] (middle) at the [[2019 Internationaux de France]] medal ceremony]]\nHaving already had [[Adam Rippon]] collaborate as a choreographer the previous season, Bell added Rippon as part of her coaching team in addition to having him again choreograph her short program, this time to [[Britney Spears]] music on Rippon's recommendation.<ref name=NBC190926/>  Starting her season on the [[2019-20 ISU Challenger Series|Challenger series]] at the [[2019 CS Nebelhorn Trophy]], Bell placed first in both segments to win the event, her first international gold medal.<ref name=USFS190928/>\n\nFor her first [[2019-20 ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating|Grand Prix]] assignment, Bell competed at the [[2019 Internationaux de France]], placing third in the short program with only an unclear edge warning on her triple flip.<ref name=GS191101/>  In the free skate, Bell underrotated a triple Lutz but otherwise landed all jumps cleanly and placed second in the segment, edging out reigning [[2019 World Figure Skating Championships|World]] and [[2018 Winter Olympics|Olympic]] champion [[Alina Zagitova]]. She was third overall, behind [[Alena Kostornaia]] and Zagitova, taking her second Grand Prix medal. Bell said she was \"proud of how this competition went.\"<ref name=GS191102/>  Competing next at the [[2019 Rostelecom Cup]], Bell placed third in the short program despite falling on her jump combination.<ref name=GS191115/> She was also third in the free skate, winning another bronze medal.<ref name=GS191116/>\n\nBell placed third in the short program at the [[2020 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|2020 U.S. Championships]] when, after landing her jumps successfully, she fell in her step sequence. She remarked after, \"today, maybe I felt a little too good.\"<ref name=GS200124/>  Placing second in the free skate with no errors other than an underrotated triple Lutz, Bell won the silver medal and was the highest-finishing medalist eligible for senior international competition, the gold medal going again to [[Alysa Liu]]. Her free skate received a standing ovation, which she called \"a very special feeling. I hadn’t had that before in my career.\"<ref name=GS200125/>  Bell subsequently eschewed attending the [[2020 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|Four Continents Championships]] in [[Seoul]], looking ahead to the [[2020 World Figure Skating Championships|2020 World Championships]] in [[Montreal]], but these events were canceled as a result of the [[2019-20 COVID-19 pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=OC200822/>\n\n=== 2020–21 season ===\nAfter spending months off the ice in the midst of the pandemic, Bell resumed training in June 2020, stating that she hoped to use the time to work on developing a [[Axel jump|triple Axel]], which she described as having \"always been something that I believe that I can do.\"<ref name=OC200822/> She competed at the first opportunity of the ISP Points Challenge, a virtual U.S. domestic competition, winning both segments of the competition, despite only doing one jump combination in the free skate. It was announced that she would be a virtual guest skater at the [[Japan Open (figure skating)|Japan Open]].<ref name=jo20/>\n\nBell was assigned to compete at the [[2020 Skate America]] event on the [[2020-21 ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating|Grand Prix circuit]], the ISU having made assignments based on training location due to the pandemic.<ref name=IFS201020/> Bell won the short program with a clean skate, more than three points ahead of [[Bradie Tennell]] in second place.<ref name=GS201023/>  This would prove decisive, as she placed fourth in the free skate after falling on an underrotated triple Lutz and only attempting six triple jumps, but her short program score was sufficient to retain the overall lead and win her first Grand Prix gold medal.<ref name=GS201026/>\n\nBell's success at Skate America and the prior season's national championships lead many to identify her as the favorite going into the [[2021 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|2021 U.S. Championships]], particularly with defending champion Liu struggling with growth-related jumping limitations.<ref name=CBC200114/><ref name=NBC201211/>  She unexpectedly placed third in the short program after underrotating her triple Lutz and called it a disappointment.<ref name=GS200115/>  Bell struggled in the free skate, falling on a triple flip and making several other jump errors; as a result, she placed fifth in that segment and dropped to fifth place overall.<ref name=GS200116/>\n\n=== 2021–22 season ===\nHeading into the Olympic season, Bell prepared new programs for the occasion. For the short program, she recruited ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race]]'' contestant [[Denali (drag queen)|Cordero Zuckerman]] to work with [[Adam Rippon]] on a stylistic homage to [[vogue (dance)|vogue]] set to the music of [[Lady Gaga]]. Her free skate to [[Joni Mitchell]]'s \"[[Both Sides Now]]\", music Bell had considered using before, was meant to reflect the highs and lows of her career: \"Skating to 'Hallelujah' at nationals was an incredible feeling — but I can still know what it was like the following year, to get off the ice and see myself in fifth.\"<ref name=USFSA210525/> However, following her bronze medal showing at the [[Skating Club of Boston]]'s [[Cranberry Cup International|Cranberry Cup]] international event and feedback from American officials, she subsequently dropped both programs, reviving her \"Hallelujah\" program and creating a new short program.<ref name=ISU-2122/>\n\nBell's two [[2021-22 ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating|Grand Prix]] assignments were the final two events of the series, starting with the [[2021 Internationaux de France]], where she placed sixth. She was tenth in the short program and fourth in the free skate.<ref name=GS211120/> At her second event the following week, the [[2021 Rostelecom Cup]], Bell was third in the short program despite not landing a triple-triple combination, dropping to fourth after the free skate. She said, \"technical content is a little bit lower right now, but I plan to put the triple-triple back in later during the season.\"<ref name=GS211128/>\n\nBell entered the [[2022 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|2022 U.S. Championships]] as a contender for both the title and the [[United States at the 2022 Winter Olympics|American Olympic team]]. Frequent rival [[Bradie Tennell]] withdrew in advance due to injury. Bell won the short program, narrowly ahead of [[Karen Chen]], while [[Alysa Liu]] was further back in third and withdrew before the free skate due to testing positive for [[COVID-19]]. Bell won the free skate as well, taking her first national title.<ref name=GS220108/> The following day, she was named to the Olympic team, along with Chen and Liu.<ref name=NBC220112/> At 25, Bell became the oldest U.S. women's champion since [[Beatrix Loughran]] in 1927, and also the oldest American women's singles skater sent to the Olympics since Loughran in [[United States at the 1928 Winter Olympics|1928]].<ref name=CBS220108/>\n\nCompeting at the [[2022 Winter Olympics]] in the [[Figure skating at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Women's singles|women's event]], Bell fell on her opening triple-triple combination attempt but nevertheless qualified for the free skate in eleventh position.<ref name=NBC220215/> She moved up one place in the free skate to finish tenth overall.<ref name=GS220217/>\n\nDays after the Olympics concluded, [[Vladimir Putin]] ordered an [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine|invasion of Ukraine]], as a result of which the [[International Skating Union]] banned all Russian and Belarusian skaters from competing at the [[2022 World Figure Skating Championships|2022 World Championships]]. This had a major impact on the women's field, dominated by Russians for most of the preceding eight years, and Bell entered the event as a podium contender.<ref name=CBC220322/> She finished third in the short program with a new personal best score of 72.55, taking a bronze small medal, the first for an American at the World Championships since [[Ashley Wagner]] in [[2016 World Figure Skating Championships|2016]].<ref name=NBC220323/> In the free skate, Bell struggled on both of her triple Lutzes in the second half of the program, underrotating one of them. She dropped from third to fourth overall, behind Liu.<ref name=GS220325/><ref name=NBC220325/>\n\n==== Retirement ====\nOn October 12, 2022, Bell announced on [[Instagram]] that she was retiring from competitive figure skating and said she would continue performing at ice shows.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Brockington |first1=Ariana |title=Mariah Bell announces retirement from figure skating |url=https://www.today.com/news/sports/mariah-bell-retiring-figure-skating-rcna52021 |access-date=13 October 2022 |work=TODAY.com |publisher=NBC Universal |date=12 October 2022 |language=en |archive-date=13 October 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221013013213/https://www.today.com/news/sports/mariah-bell-retiring-figure-skating-rcna52021 |url-status=live }}</ref> She participated in the Japan Open later that fall, finishing sixth among the six female competitors and winning silver with Team North America.<ref name=OC231007/>\n\n== Programs ==\n[[File:2019 Internationaux de France Saturday medals ladies 8D9A2623.jpg|thumb|260px|right|Bell at the [[2019 Internationaux de France]] medal ceremony]]\n[[File:Mariah Bell at the Four Continents Championships 2017 - FS.jpg|thumb|right|Bell at the [[2017 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|2017 Four Continents Championships]]]]\n{|class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n|-\n!

The plants are generally tropical herbs or subshrubs with velvety stems and foliage and brightly colored flowers with spots or markings in contrasting colors. They are rhizomatous and commonly include a period of dormancy in their growth cycle. The genus was revised in 1992 and was then recognized as having 19 species distributed in [[Central America]] and [[South America]]. [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] in 2005 indicated that the epiphytic genus ''Capanea'' is derived from within ''Kohleria'', and the two species of ''Capanea'' were subsequently transferred to ''Kohleria''. The genus ''[[Pearcea]]'' is closely related.\n\nBecause of their colorful and exotically patterned flowers, as well as a general interest in the many tropical flowering plants that were being introduced from the Americas, kohlerias were very popular in [[England]] and [[Europe]] in the 19th century. Many species and [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] were lavishly illustrated in horticultural magazines such as Curtis's Botanical Magazine under the discarded or erroneous names of ''[[Achimenes]]'', ''[[Gesneria]]'', ''[[Isotoma (plant)|Isoloma]]'', ''[[Sciadocalyx]]'', and ''[[Tydaea]]''.  These species and hybrids almost entirely disappeared in the early 20th century, and [[plant breeders]] have only recently begun to work extensively with this genus again.\n\nSeveral species are widespread, variable, weedy, and tend to hybridize in the wild, and numerous names have been described that are synonyms of other species or are hybrid taxa.\n\n== Species ==\n{{As of|2024|August}}, [[Plants of the World Online]] accepted the following species:<ref name=\"POWO_17084-1\">{{cite web |title=''Kohleria'' Regel |work=Plants of the World Online |publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|url=https://powo.science.kew.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:17084-1 |access-date=9 August 2024}}</ref>\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*''[[Kohleria affinis]]'' <small>(Fritsch) Roalson & Boggan</small> (syn.

Numerous species and hybrids are now in cultivation, some with patterned or variegated foliage as well as vivid flowers.

It is one of the older settlements in the area. It is the seat of the [[Luuq District]]. The town is located in a bend of the [[Juba River]], where the watercourse flows down from north to south in a horseshoe shape. Luuq is also known as '''Luuq Gan naane'''.\n\n==Overview==\nThe name Luuq in the [[Somali language]] means \"alley\" by virtue of the city's geographical setting. The river has great influence on the city and its surrounding areas. The entrance of the city gate is situated not more than 100 meters from the river banks on both the eastern and western sides of the town. About 4&nbsp;km past the city center and main Luuq Market, the river encloses the city again completely.<ref>{{cite book|title=Huddur & the History of Southern Somalia|publisher=Nahda Bookshop Publisher|year=2005|isbn=9772004992|first=Salah|last=Mohammed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UGEwAQAAIAAJ&q=Huddur+%26+the+History+of+Southern+Somalia+page+50 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Medieval===\nWith the expansion of coastal-interior trade in the south, both the coastal town of Benadir and its inland sister \"town of Luuq\" on [[Gedo|upper Jubba]] had grown into an important emporium. The Bender-Luuq caravan trade used the southern region of [[Ethiopia]] as an economic catchment area to access new and valued commodities such as coffee, gold, and slaves. In the [[Shebelle River|Shebelle]] and [[Jubba river|Jubba]] valleys, the emergence of the political power of the [[gasaargude saldante]] coincided with this period of southern expansion of the interior caravan trade which boosted urban centers across the inter-riverine regions. The Ajuran Somalis \"established and maintained control over the coastal regions and built roads connecting the interior urban centers which further boosted prosperity in southern Somalia. As the political power grew, so the [[Ajuran Sultanate|Ajuran]] extended their control of the coastal-interior caravan trade reaching Ethiopia.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Climate Change Adaptation in Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fvAABAAAQBAJ&q=Climate+Change+Adaptation+in+Africa%3A+An+Historical+Ecology |page=74 |first=Gufu|last=Obba|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317745914|year=2014}}</ref>\n\nAmong the most important inland market towns were Luuq and [[Bardera]] on the [[Jubba river|Jubba]] river. Then the goods from the interior were exported as far as Southeast Asia.<ref>{{cite book|title=Climate Change Adaptation in Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fvAABAAAQBAJ&q=Climate+Change+Adaptation+in+Africa%3A+An+Historical+Ecology |first=Gufu|page=74|last=Obba|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317745914|year=2014}}</ref>\n\n===Early Modern===\nLuuq was one of the most important cities in [[Geledi Sultanate]] led by the Gasaaragude dynasty part of the Geledi federation that governed the [[Gedo|upper Jubba]] region. Luuq was the largest city in [[Jubba river|Jubba]] river and served as the military center for the kingdom. All prisoners were locked in the Luuq prison facility. Anyone who wanted to join the army were trained in Luuq. All the weapons were made in Luuq.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DPwOsOcNy5YC |title=Historical Dictionary of Somalia |page=116|date= 25 February 2003|isbn=9780810866041 |accessdate=2014-02-15|last1=Mukhtar |first1=Mohamed Haji }}</ref> According to captain Thomas Smee in his 1811 report to the authorities of British India wrote the city was heavily fortified and had over 2 thousand stone houses with mosques, roads including palaces, and castles in the center.<ref>Edward A.

The inland commercial centers in Jubbaland \"formerly a seat of flourishing and extensive trade, and a commercial and enterprising people\" and the coastal commercial nodes of the Benadir, particularly [[Barawa]], provided goods for the interior markets. The caravans from the Benadir stopped in [[Bale Zone|Bale]] to attract trade goods from the surrounding regions. Cattle barter for \"expensive beads, copper, and better quality goods\" was popular. The traders of Luuq \"reached such sophistication that [they had] a highly developed system of weights and measures, credit was available, and written contracts were signed between the merchants the caravans who carried their merchandise into the interior\". The importance of Luuq was its proximity to the [[Arsi Zone|Arsi]] and [[Borena Zone|Borana]] regions. Market transactions between Luuq-based Somali traders and the Oromo pastoralists were complex in terms of methods used to obtain ivory, the most valued trade item, from the interior: \"Somali traders (Rahaween tribe) would first have to exchange cotton cloth for cattle from the Oromo herdsmen. The cattle were then traded to the hunters for ivory.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Climate Change Adaptation in Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fvAABAAAQBAJ&q=Climate+Change+Adaptation+in+Africa%3A+An+Historical+Ecology |page=75 |first=Gufu|last=Obba|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317745914|year=2014}}</ref>\n\n===Colonial Period===\nLuuq came under indirect Italian control by 1907, and Italian interest in the town was serious enough for them to demarcate the only segment of the Somali-Ethiopian boundary in order to include Luuq as part of [[Italian Somaliland]].<ref>Lewis, ''Modern History'', pp. 88f</ref>\n\n===Modern===\nAfter independence in 1960, the city was made the center of the official [[Luuq District]] and served as the political center for [[Gedo]] region.\n\nOn March 7, 2011, [[Transitional Federal Government]] forces and allied militia captured Luuq from [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabaab]] rebels, encountering little or no resistance.<ref>{{Cite news| last=Guled | first=Abdi | title=Somali president claims victory in war with rebels  | url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2014424654_apafsomalia.html | newspaper=[[Seattle Times]] | agency=[[Associated Press]] | date=2011-03-07 | accessdate=2011-03-07 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | title=Somali troops, militia take two towns from rebels | url=https://af.reuters.com/article/ethiopiaNews/idAFLDE72604720110307?sp=true | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830013304/http://af.reuters.com/article/ethiopiaNews/idAFLDE72604720110307?sp=true | url-status=dead | archive-date=2012-08-30 | work=[[Reuters]] | date=2011-03-07 | accessdate=2011-03-07 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, Luuq and other settlements in the wider Gedo region were officially incorporated into the newly formed [[Jubaland]] autonomous state.<ref name=\"Sjgraibtie\">{{cite news|title=Somalia: Jubaland gains recognition after intense bilateral talks in Ethiopia |url=http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_Jubaland_gains_recognition_after_intense_bilateral_talks_in_Ethiopia_printer.shtml |accessdate=11 September 2013 |newspaper=Garowe Online |date=28 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012043444/http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_Jubaland_gains_recognition_after_intense_bilateral_talks_in_Ethiopia_printer.shtml |archivedate=12 October 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\nLuuq has a population of around 41,000 inhabitants.<ref name=\"Tsctp\">{{cite web|title=Somalia City & Town Population|url=http://www.tageo.com/index-e-so-cities-SO.htm|publisher=Tageo|accessdate=4 October 2013}}</ref>{{better source needed|date=July 2018}} The broader [[Luuq District]] has a total population of 185,703 residents.<ref name=\"Rdatp\">{{cite web|title=Regions, districts, and their populations: Somalia 2005 (draft)|url=https://docs.unocha.org/sites/dms/Somalia/UNDP-POP-RURAL-URBAN%202005.pdf|publisher=UNDP|accessdate=21 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Climate==\nLuuq has a [[hot desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BWh'').

Located in the southwestern end of the city of Peshawar, it is the fourth-busiest airport in Pakistan.\n\nOne of the main runways of the airport is crossed by a railway line known as the [[Khyber train safari]], which runs to the town of [[Landi Kotal]] in the [[Khyber Pass]] for the express purpose of tourism. The airport was renamed on 27 January 2012 after [[Abdul Ghaffar Khan]] (nicknamed ''Bacha Khan''), leader of the [[Khudai Khidmatgar]] and a prominent [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] [[Pashtun nationalism|Nationalist]] figure.<ref>[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2012\\story_28-1-2012_pg7_8 Peshawar Airport gets a new name] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024033442/http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2012 |date=24 October 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Hamling |first=Anna |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1ei4DwAAQBAJ&dq=Abdul+Ghaffar+khan+pashtun&pg=PA173 |title=Contemporary Icons of Nonviolence |date=2019-10-16 |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |isbn=978-1-5275-4173-3 |language=en}}</ref> The airport was extensively reconstructed from 2016 to 2018.\n\n== History ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2012}}\nStrategically situated in the heart of Peshawar, Bacha Khan International Airport is located approximately 180&nbsp;km from [[Islamabad]] (federal capital of Pakistan) which makes it about a two-hour drive from the capital via M-1 motorway. Since Peshawar is the capital of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, it provides world connections for the majority of the northwest region of the country and adjoining areas of Afghanistan. Since the province has a large Afghan [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] community residing within KPK, Afghanistan flights have always been on the rise.\n\nThe airport traces its origins to 1927 when there was a small airfield that catered to much of the [[British Empire]] and [[Imperial Airways]] aircraft that were either travelling onwards to the east (e.g. to China and Malaysia/Singapore) or west (e.g. Europe and America). For this reason the city was given the nickname \"Gateway to the East\" because it linked the traditional oriental culture to modern occidental traditions.\n\nThe airport gained importance after the independence of Pakistan from the British Raj; the [[Civil Aviation Authority of Pakistan]] (CAA) and the [[Pakistan Air Force]] started to use the airfield jointly for both military and civil operations. There were countless flights operated to and from Pakistan's largest city, Karachi, as well as other cities within the newly formed state.\n\nThe airport achieved international status in 1965 when the first flight was operated from [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]] to Peshawar. The flight was operated by the national flag carrier, [[Pakistan International Airlines]] (PIA). As years went on the airport grew with more flights and aircraft and relative upgrade was carried out from time to time. It was not until 1981 that the CAA extended the terminal to meet future needs for the next decade and to meet the estimated growth of passengers. The apron was developed fully by 1986, where the airport was able to handle four widebody aircraft and two small narrow body aircraft at one time.\n\nPIA commenced service to Birmingham in July 2004.<ref>{{cite news | title=Peshawar route opens | work=Birmingham Post | date=2004-07-15 | id={{ProQuest|323937544}}}}</ref> In January 2008 the provincial government met to discuss the expansion work needed to upgrade the quality of the aircraft in terms of facilities, terminal modernisation and cargo growth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daily.pk/component/content/article/13-joomla/1671-high-level-meeting-discusses-expansion-of-peshawar-airport-in-pakistan.html |title=High level meeting discusses expansion of Peshawar airport in Pakistan |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20090211113406/http://www.daily.pk/component/content/article/13-joomla/1671-high-level-meeting-discusses-expansion-of-peshawar-airport-in-pakistan.html |archive-date=11 February 2009 }}</ref> In June 2008 the Deputy Director General of the CAA, Air Vice Marshal Sajid Habib, said that five billion rupees have been allocated to expand and develop Peshawar airport.

The airport is currently under evaluation to be upgraded. The [[Civil Aviation Authority of Pakistan|CAA]] is currently working with the provincial government to develop the airport to meet international standards. The airport has some facilities to handle the basic needs of travellers, such as telephone booths (domestic/international), currency exchange, automatic teller machines (ATMs), Internet stations (powered by [[Wateen]]), information counters, gifts and souvenir shops, snack shops, rental car services, and a post office.\n\nThe runway is {{convert|9000|ft}} long, {{convert|150|ft}} wide with {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} shoulders on either side corresponding to International Civil Aviation Organisation Category 4E. It is crossed by a (rarely-operational) railway line, one of the few such runways in the world. Max capacity: [[Boeing 777]]-300ER.\nThere is nose-in parking for 4 wide-bodied aircraft at a time or 3 Airbus and 2 narrow-body aircraft at a time.\nThe airport has 2 [[Jet bridge|air bridges]] which were constructed in 2018.\n\n==Airlines and destinations==\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2020}}\n<!-- Please use only independent sources.

His plane was shot down and he was captured and put on trial in the USSR. This triggered the [[1960 U-2 incident|U-2 crisis of 1960]].\n* On 26 March 1965, a PIA [[Douglas DC-3|Douglas C-47A-1-DK]] took off from the airport. The aircraft lost contact with air traffic control mid flight. The aircraft had crash landed at the [[Lowery Pass]]. All passengers and crew did not survive the accident and the aircraft was written off.\n* A PIA [[Fokker F27 Friendship]] was making a night approach at the airport on 23 October 1986. Due to co-pilot error, the aircraft was lower than expected. The aircraft undershot the runway, causing it to land in a ditch which caused the aircraft to break up. Thirteen passengers and crew sustained serious injuries and the aircraft was written off.\n* Six international airlines had temporarily suspended flights to Peshawar in view of the deteriorating security situation in that part of Pakistan. This followed a rocket attack on the airport in August 2009. The absence of a functional [[star (classification)|five star]] hotel in the city after the [[Pearl Continental hotel bombing]] was also said to be one of the causes. The airlines were Saudi Arabian Airlines, Emirates Airlines, Gulf Air, Air Arabia, Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/daily_detail.asp?id=203978 |title=The News International: Latest, Breaking, Pakistan, Sports and Video News |access-date=1 June 2015 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> All the airlines resumed services to the city after a short hiatus, and RAK Airways even commenced new services as well.\n* On 15 December 2012, the airport suffered [[2012 Bacha Khan International Airport attack|a coordinated assault]] by a team of terrorists, which killed nine people. \n* On 25 June 2014, [[Pakistan International Airlines Flight 756]], an [[Airbus A330-300|Airbus A330-324ET]] registered as AP-BGN, originating from [[Riyadh]] was fired upon while it was flying at low altitude and landing at Peshawar, by unknown gunmen positioned outside the airport's vicinity. One woman was killed, while two passengers and a flight steward were reported injured who were rushed to hospital.
