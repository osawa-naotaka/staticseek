She had met the flautist [[Andrew Ashe]] at the Dublin Rotunda concerts and he now directed the Bath concerts. He introduced her to [[Venanzio Rauzzini]] who gave her singing lessons. Rauzzini tried her out at a benefit concert for Ashe and she was then engaged by the \"Catch Club\" in Bath. Her benefit there in 1792 raised enough money to pay off her husband's debts.

U. Grozier in command. Soon after her commissioning, she steamed to [[New York, NY]], where she decommissioned on 24 August 1865, and was laid up at the [[New York Navy Yard]].\n\n''Nausett'' was a ''Casco''-class, light-draft monitor intended for service in the shallow bays, rivers, and inlets of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. These warships sacrificed [[armor plate]] for a shallow [[draft (hull)|draft]] and were fitted with a [[Sailing ballast|ballast]] compartment designed to lower them in the water during battle.\n\n==Design revisions==\n{{stack|[[File:FMIB 37114 Le Monitor Americain Le Nauset, construit a Boston en 1862.jpg|thumb|Model of the ''Nausett'', built in Boston in 1862]]}}\nThe contract to Donald McKay was originally announced in 1863.<ref>{{cite news|title=Donald McKay to Build an Iron-Clad|url=http://digital.tcl.sc.edu/cdm/ref/collection/NSN/id/432|access-date=1 October 2014|work=The New South|date=14 November 1863}}</ref>  Though the original designs for the ''Casco''-class monitors were drawn by [[John Ericsson]], the final revision was created by Chief Engineer Alban C. Stimers following [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Samuel F. Du Pont]]'s failed bombardment of [[Fort Sumter]] in 1863. By the time that the plans were put before the Monitor Board in [[New York City]], Ericsson and Stimers had a poor relationship, and Chief of the [[Bureau of Construction and Repair]] [[John Lenthall (shipbuilder)|John Lenthall]] had little connection to the board. This resulted in the plans being approved and 20 vessels ordered without serious scrutiny of the new design. $14 million US was allocated for the construction of these vessels.

Alan Wallace, ''Contemplative Science.'' Columbia University Press, 2007, pages 97–98.</ref> The question of an independent creator deity was answered by the Buddha in the [[Brahmajala Sutta (Theravada)|Brahmajala Sutta]]. The Buddha denounced the view of a creator and sees that such notions are related to the false view of [[Sassatavada|eternalism]], and like the 61 other views, this belief causes [[Dukkha|suffering]] when one is [[Upādāna|attached]] to it and states these views may lead to desire, aversion and delusion.

Another quotation from Tillich is, \"God does not exist. He is being itself beyond essence and existence. Therefore to argue that God exists is to deny him.\"<ref>Tillich, Paul. (1951) ''Systematic Theology'', p.205.</ref> This Tillich quotation summarizes [[Transtheism|his conception of God]]. He does not think of God as a being that exists in time and space, because that constrains God, and makes God finite. But all beings are finite, and if God is the Creator of all beings, God cannot logically be finite since a finite being cannot be the sustainer of an infinite variety of finite things. Thus God is considered beyond being, above finitude and limitation, the power or essence of being itself.{{cn|date=July 2020}}\n\nFrom a nontheistic, [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalist]], and [[Rationalism|rationalist]] perspective, the concept of divine grace appears to be the same concept as [[luck]].<ref>Kaufman, Arnold S. \"Ability\", ''The Journal of Philosophy'', Vol. 60, No. 19</ref>\n\n===Nontheist Quakers===\n[[File:Nontheist.JPG|thumb|150px|Logo of the Society of Nontheist Friends]]\n{{Main|Nontheist Quakers}}\nA nontheist Friend or an atheist Quaker is someone who affiliates with, identifies with, engages in and/or affirms [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] practices and processes, but who does not accept a belief in a theistic understanding of [[God]], a Supreme Being, the [[divinity|divine]], the [[soul]] or the [[supernatural]].

Zaehner, (1966) ''Hinduism'', P.1-2, Oxford University Press.</ref> More broadly, Hinduism can be seen as having three more important strands: one featuring a personal Creator or Divine Being, second that emphasises an impersonal Absolute and a third that is pluralistic and non-absolute.

Oxford University Press .</ref>\n\nAlthough the Vedas are broadly concerned with the completion of ritual, there are some elements that can be interpreted as either nontheistic or precursors to the later developments of the nontheistic tradition. The oldest Hindu scripture, the [[Rig Veda]] mentions that 'There is only one god though the sages may give it various names' (1.164.46). [[Max Müller]] termed this [[henotheism]], and it can be seen as indicating one, non-dual divine reality, with little emphasis on personality.<ref>Masih, Y.

The Upanishads can be seen as the expression of new sources of power in India. Also, separate from the Upanishadic tradition were bands of wandering ascetics called Vadins whose largely nontheistic notions rejected the notion that religious knowledge was the property of the Brahmins. Many of these were [[shramana]]s, who represented a non-Vedic tradition rooted in India's pre-Aryan history.<ref>Jaroslav Krejčí, Anna Krejčová (1990) Before the European Challenge: The Great Civilizations of Asia and the Middle East, p:170, SUNY Press, {{ISBN|0-7914-0168-5}}</ref> The emphasis of the Upanishads turned to knowledge, specifically the ultimate identity of all phenomena.<ref>Doniger, Wendy, (1990) ''Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions'', P. 441, Merriam-Webster, {{ISBN|0-87779-044-2}}</ref> This is expressed in the notion of [[Brahman]], the key idea of the Upanishads, and much later philosophizing has been taken up with deciding whether Brahman is personal or impersonal.<ref>Smart, Ninian (1998) The World's Religions P.73-74, CUP {{ISBN|0-521-63748-1}}</ref> The understanding of the nature of Brahman as impersonal is based in the definition of it as 'ekam eva advitiyam' (Chandogya Upanishad 6.2.1) – it is one without a second and to which no substantive predicates can be attached.<ref>Wainwright, William J.

Vs. 13, Advaita Ashrama, Calcutta {{ISBN|81-7505-150-7}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Advaita Vedanta]] of [[Gaudapada]] and [[Adi Shankara|Sankara]] rejects theism as a consequence of its insistence that Brahman is \"Without attributes, indivisible, subtle, inconceivable, and without blemish, Brahman is one and without a second. There is nothing other than He.\"<ref>Richards, John, [http://www.realization.org/page/namedoc0/vc/vc_10.htm ''Viveka-Chudamani of Shankara'' Vs 468.]</ref> This means that it lacks properties usually associated with God such as omniscience, perfect goodness, omnipotence, and additionally is identical with the whole of reality, rather than being a causal agent or ruler of it.<ref>Wainright, William, (2006), [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/concepts-god/ ''Concepts of God''], Stanford Encyclopedia of Religion</ref>\n\n==Jainism==\n{{Main|God in Jainism}}\n{{Further|Jainism and non-creationism}}\nJain texts claim that the universe consists of ''[[jiva]]'' (life force or souls) and [[ajiva]] (lifeless objects). According to Jain doctrine, the universe and its constituents – soul, matter, space, time, and principles of motion – have always existed. The universe and the matter and souls within it are eternal and uncreated, and there is no omnipotent [[creator god]]. Jainism offers an elaborate cosmology, including heavenly beings/''devas'', but these heavenly beings are not viewed as creators-they are subject to suffering and change like all other living beings, and are portrayed as mortal.\n\nAccording to the Jain concept of divinity, any soul who destroys its ''[[Karma in Jainism|karmas]]'' and desires, achieves liberation/Nirvana. A soul who destroys all its passions and desires has no desire to interfere in the working of the universe. If godliness is defined as the state of having freed one's soul from ''karmas'' and the attainment of enlightenment/Nirvana and a god as one who exists in such a state, then those who have achieved such a state can be termed gods (''[[Tirthankara]]'').\n\nBesides scriptural authority, Jains also employ [[syllogism]] and [[deductive reasoning]] to refute [[creationism|creationist]] theories. Various views on divinity and the universe held by the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedics]], [[samkhya|Sāmkhyas]], [[Mīmāṃsā|Mimamsas]], Buddhists, and other school of thoughts were criticized by Jain Ācāryas, such as [[Jinasena]] in [[Adipurana|Mahāpurāna]].\n\n==Taoism==\n{{Main|Taoist theology}}\nChinese [[Taoism]] or Daoism originally emphasizes the otherness of the divine, the [[Tao]], which is at the same time [[Immanence|immanent]] and [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]], but not [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]]. Only in later Taoism does a [[Chinese gods and immortals|pantheon of gods]] emerge, and even then they are considered deities inferior to the principle of Tao, often representing cosmic or heavenly concepts. The god [[Shangdi]] might have originally as a symbolic of the Pole Star in northern China, eventually becoming a kind of intermediary between the impersonal Tao and the world of active creation. There is no [[creator deity]] in traditional Taoism, and universe is held to be in constant creation and change.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cooper|first=Jean C.|title=An Illustrated Introduction to Taoism|date=2010|publisher=Joseph A.

The skin was not tin but [[Alclad]]. The airship was roughly teardrop shaped and had eight small [[Stabilizer (aircraft)|stabilizer]] fins, four of which had [[rudder]]s. It was held together with over 3.5 million [[rivet]]s,<ref>Sullivan 1988</ref> which were applied by an innovative sewing machine-like device which produced airtight seams.<ref name=Morrow />\n\nThe ZMC-2 was {{convert|52|feet|m}} in diameter and {{convert|150|feet|m}} feet long.<ref name=Morrow /> The control car was {{convert|24|feet|m}} feet long by {{convert|6|feet|m}} feet wide.<ref name=Morrow /> It contained three fuel tanks to give a maximum cruising range of about {{convert|600|mi|km}}.<ref name=\"Morrow and Fritsche 1987\"/> The ZMC-2 was powered by two Wright Whirlwind J5 engines of {{convert|200|hp|kW}} each, carried on outriggers and mounted in a tractor arrangement, rather than the pusher position usually employed on blimps.<ref name=Morrow /> At first the landing gear was an unusual hollow steel ball about the size and shape of an American football, mounted on a tripod attached to the car.<ref name=Morrow /> This was done to create a shape with less drag in order to guarantee the Navy's requirement of a {{convert|62|mph|km/h}} top speed. Later, after the ZMC-2 had attained this speed with ease, the ball was replaced with a conventional swivelling soft tire.<ref name=Morrow />\n\nThe crew consisted of a pilot, copilot and flight engineer-navigator, with space for one or two additional passengers.\n\n==Assembly==\n[[File:Detroit ZMC-2 metal-clad airship.jpg|thumb|Detroit ZMC-2 in the hangar]]\nThe ZMC-2 was constructed out of [[Alclad]], corrosion resistant aluminium sheet formed from high-purity aluminium surface layers metallurgically bonded to high strength aluminium alloy core material.<ref name=Morrow /> The result was about as strong as carbon or mild steel.<ref name=Morrow />{{clarify| what do you mean by strong? what are the figures?|date=June 2018}} The downside was that Alclad was thicker than sheet aluminum, making the ship several hundred pounds heavier than originally envisioned.<ref name=Morrow /> The aircraft was already under construction, and over 20 feet of the nose completed using [[duraluminum]] when the decision was made to switch to Alclad.<ref name=Morrow /> The reason for the switch was that duraluminum is highly susceptible to corrosion, particularly in a salt water environment, the exact sort of environment a Navy blimp operates in.<ref name=Morrow /> The ZMC-2 was the first aircraft constructed from Alclad in the US, and no previous experience could be drawn upon for its handling.<ref name=Morrow />\n\nTo assemble the ZMC-2 a skin-riveting machine was developed by the ''Aviation Tool Co.'', a division of the [[Detroit Aircraft Corporation]].<ref name=Morrow /> The device was invented by Edward J. Hill, who had come to work on the ZMC-2 after leaving the [[Naval Aircraft Factory]] in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania.<ref name=Morrow /> The machine consisted of an aluminum casting, weighing about 100 pounds, and was supported on springs from a framework that ran on concentric circular rails set into the floor of the hangar. There were two sets of circular rails, one at each end of the building. Three riveting machines were made, one for each set of tracks, and one for reserve when repairs might be needed. The reason for two sets of tracks was that the hull was built in two sections, front and rear. Each end started from a circular plate suspended from the hangar roof by a cable and free to rotate as each {{convert|18|in|cm|adj=on}} wide strip Alclad was added. In this manner, each end of the ship slowly grew as succeeding rows were added, looking like a bulls eye at first and later like a huge inverted teacup.<ref name=Morrow /> Both sections were under construction continuously 24 hours a day, seven days a week, once the hull was started.\n\nThe riveting machine fed three small aluminum wires from large spools to make a seam about a quarter inch wide composed of three rivets, one above the other in a staggered pattern.<ref name=Morrow /> In theory the machine could sew about 50 feet of seam in an hour, but in practice about 10 or more feet was the average.<ref name=Morrow /> The sheets of Alclad used were eight to nine thousandths of an inch thick.<ref name=Morrow /> As the each section of the hull grew internal annular rings were added at appropriate distances to give stiffness and reinforcement to the hull skin.<ref name=Morrow /> In addition, lightweight longitudinal channels were added between the circular rings, giving the internal structure the appearance of a huge bird cage.<ref name=Morrow />\n\nThe [[helium]] gas was contained by the hull only, no fabric was used to contain the helium.<ref name=Morrow /> Inside the hull were two large airbag cells, called [[ballonet]]s, made of rubberized fabric and containing air.<ref name=Morrow /> These cells could be expanded or contracted to control pressure as the helium expanded or contracted with the heating or cooling of the atmosphere or to adapt to changes of atmospheric pressure with altitude, and to control fore and aft trim.<ref name=Morrow /> In operation the ZMC-2 was susceptible to heating and cooling effects of the sun causing it to pop and buckle in the evenings if pressure from blowers was not applied.<ref>Althoff 2003</ref> During its service life the ZMC-2 was found to have a gas diffusion rate much lower than that of fabric-hulled blimps, meaning that a much longer time would pass before additional helium needed to be added.<ref name=Morrow />\n\nAs the airship neared completion a decision had to be made on how best to fill it with helium. Once the two halves were completed they were suspended horizontally from cables attached to the hangar ceiling, and the two halves were joined with a final array of rivets.<ref name=\"Morrow p. vi\">Morrow and Fritsche 1967, p. vi</ref> Since helium mixes freely with air and is hard to separate from it, it was impractical to pump helium directly into the airship until the air was removed. It was decided that the airship would first be filled with [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>), a heavy gas that mixes less freely with helium and which is easier to separate from helium. Once filled with CO<sub>2</sub> the helium could be pumped in under pressure from valves at the top of the chamber, forcing the CO<sub>2</sub> out through valves located on the bottom, and then recovering any helium that did mix with it.<ref name=\"Morrow p. vi\" /> Only a few weeks before this procedure was to begin a bright young engineer noted that once filled with CO<sub>2</sub> the ZMC-2 would be many thousands of pounds heavier than when filled with air. The rest of the airship's assembly had to be postponed for several weeks while additional reinforcing panels and stronger connectors were attached in order to support the increased weight of the CO<sub>2</sub> filled airship.<ref name=\"Morrow p. vi\" />\n\n==Operations==\nThe airship was first flown on August 19, 1929, and transferred to [[Lakehurst, New Jersey]] in October 1929.<ref>Pace, Montgomery, and Zitarosa 2003</ref> The airship was nicknamed \"the Tin Blimp\". Its first Navy skipper was Red Dugan, who expressed reluctance at operating the airship, believing it unsafe.<ref name=\"Morrow p. v\">Morrow and Fritsche 1967, p. v.</ref> Dugan's concerns were proven wrong, though he later lost his life in the crash of another airship, [[USS Akron|''Akron'']].<ref name=\"Morrow p. v\" />\n\nIt was considered very successful as a sub-scale test vehicle, but the company that built it did not weather the [[Great Depression]] well, and by the time a successor might have been built, there was little interest in pursuing it. In the year before the Depression, the U.S. Army was seeking funding for an airship based on the ZMC-2, that would have been larger than the German ''[[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|Graf Zeppelin]]'', and powered by eight engines of {{convert|600|-|800|hp|kW PS|lk=on|abbr=on}}}. The U.S. Army planned to use it as a tender for air-launched aircraft, similar to plans the U.S. Navy had for future dirigibles. The $4.5 million need for construction was never approved by Congress.<ref>\"Metal Covered Airship To Carry Twenty Tons\" 1931 <!--source?-->, p. 552.</ref>\n\nThe ZMC-2 was operated with a zero internal pressure at speeds up to {{convert|20|mph|km/h}}, sufficient for it to be considered a 'rigid' airship.<ref>Van Treuren 2007, p. 90</ref> With its low [[fineness ratio]] of 2.83, the ZMC-2 was difficult to fly.<ref>Robinson, Douglas H. ''Giants in the Sky: A History of the Rigid Airship'' (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1979), p. 225.</ref> By 1936, the airship had travelled over {{convert|80000|mi|km}}{{clarify|date=August 2014|sm or nm?}} with little sign of corrosion.<!-- Impossible to locate this reference from these vague details: ref>{{cite book|United States.

Between December 1938 and April 1941 it only logged five hours of flight time.\n\nConsidered by the Navy as too small for anti-submarine patrols, the aging ZMC-2 was decommissioned and scrapped in 1941 after nearly 12 years of service.\n\n==Operators==\n;USA\n* [[United States Navy]]\n\n==Specifications (ZMC-2)==\n{{Aircraft specs\n|ref=<!-- reference -->\n|prime units?=imp\n<!--\n

The name Sennenhund refers to people called ''Senn'', herders in the [[Swiss Alps]]. [[Entlebuch Biosphere|Entlebuch]] is a region in the [[canton of Lucerne]] in [[Switzerland]]. The breed is also known in English as the '''Entelbuch Mountain Dog''', '''Entelbucher Cattle Dog''',  and similar combinations.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Entlebucher.jpg|thumb|right|Entlebucher Sennenhund]]\n[[File:Entlebucher sennenhund at 11 months.jpg|thumb|Entlebucher puppy at 11 months of age]]\n\nThe Entlebucher is the smallest of four Swiss mountain dogs, the others being the [[Appenzeller Sennenhund]], the [[Bernese Mountain Dog]], and the [[Greater Swiss Mountain Dog]]. During the 1800s these dogs were variable and were not regarded as distinct breeds. In 1908 the Swiss Kennel Club set about classifying them.<ref>{{cite book |last=Morris |first=Desmond |author-link=Desmond Morris |date=2001 |title=Dogs: the ultimate dictionary of over 1,000 dog breeds |location=North Pomfret, VT|publisher=Trafalgar Square Publishing |pages=470|isbn=1-57076-219-8}}</ref> In 1913, four bobtail Entlebucher Sennenhund were [[conformation show|shown]] to [[Albert Heim]], an advocate for the increasingly rare Sennenhund breeds.

It has small, triangular ears and rather small brown eyes. The head is well proportioned to the body, with a strong flat skull. The long jaw is well formed and powerful. The feet are compact, supporting its muscular body. The smooth coat is close and smooth with symmetrical markings of black, tan, and white. This tricolor coat has white on its toes, tail-tip, and the chest and blaze where the fur is soft and fluffy; the tan always lies between the black and the white. It has muscular, broad hips. The hocks are naturally well angled. The tail is sometimes [[Docking (dog)|docked]], a practice which is now prohibited by law in many countries, or it may have a natural bobtail.<ref name=\"Clark\" /> Height at the [[withers]] is 19-20 ins (48–50&nbsp;cm) and weight is  45-65&nbsp;lbs (20–30&nbsp;kg).\n\n==Temperament==\nAs with all large, active working dogs, this breed should be well socialized early in life with other dogs and people, and  be provided with regular activity and training. Temperament of individual dogs may vary. The [[breed standard (dog)|Standard]] says that the breed is \"good-natured and devoted towards people familiar to him, slightly suspicious of strangers.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fci.be/uploaded_files/047A2001_en.doc |title=Entlebuch Cattle Dog (Entlebucher Sennenhund) |date=June 28, 2002 |access-date=April 4, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606223615/http://www.fci.be/uploaded_files/047A2001_en.doc |archive-date=June 6, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==Kennel club recognition==\nThe Entlebucher Sennenhund  is recognised internationally by the [[Fédération Cynologique Internationale]], using the standard written in the breed's native Switzerland.

Play parties began in the 1830s in the [[United States]] as a route around strict [[religion|religious]] practices banning dancing and the playing of [[musical instrument]]s. The areas most influenced by the practice were the Southern and Midwestern parts of the United States. [[Folk song]]s, many of [[Europe]]an and [[England|English]] origin, were used as means to give the attendants choreographed movements for each phrase. No instruments were played at the events, as they were banned by the religious movements of the area. Singing and clapping were used to convey each song.

At the age of seven, an accident damaged one of his eyes, affecting his ability to learn in school. As a result, he was sent for by his father who was living in [[Panama]].<ref name=\"archer\">{{cite web |title=John Dunkley (1891-1947) |url=http://petrinearcher.com/john-dunkley-1891-1947 |website=Petrine Archer [.com] |accessdate=19 December 2018}}</ref> Upon arrival, the teen-aged Dunkley discovered his father had recently died and was buried the day before he landed.<ref name=\"blog\">{{cite web |title=John Dunkley (1891-1947) |url=https://nationalgalleryofjamaica.wordpress.com/2009/12/24/john-dunkley-1891-1947/ |website=National Gallery of Jamaica Blog |date=24 December 2009 |accessdate=18 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nDeprived of his father's wealth, Dunkley started earning his own livelihood. Like many of his impoverished black countrymen, he sought work throughout the [[Caribbean]],<ref name=\"artfix\"/> stopping in [[Colón, Panama]]; [[Chiriquí Province|Chiriqui]], Panama; [[Costa Rica]] and [[Camaguey, Cuba]]. A [[banana plantation]] where he worked in Panama would later inspire a number of his paintings.<ref name=\"artfix\"/> He reportedly started out from Cuba for [[California]] to study [[dentistry]] when an armed upheaval took place. He lost all of his belongings, but was spared his life. According to his wife, Dunkley, who was a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]], sent out the Masons' distress signal, which was answered by a lodge member on a passing ship. Welcomed aboard, he signed on as a sailor, traveling to England, Scotland, North and South America and numerous other places.<ref name=\"blog\"/> He may also have worked on the construction of the [[Panama Canal]].<ref name=\"rail\">{{cite web |last1=Poupeye |first1=Veerle |title=John Dunkley: Neither Day nor Night |url=https://miamirail.org/visual-arts/john-dunkley-neither-day-nor-night/ |website=The Miami Rail |date=28 November 2017 |accessdate=20 December 2018}}</ref> \n\nHe returned to Chiriqui, where he set up a barbershop and started painting in his spare time, encouraged by Clarence Rock, a prominent Panamanian photographer.<ref name=\"blog\"/> Sometime between 1926 and 1930, Dunkley returned to Jamaica, establishing his barbering business on lower Princess Street in Kingston.<ref name=\"blog\"/> He covered the entirety of the shop's exterior with small painted signs depicting flowers, trees and vines.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Coates |first1=Robert |last2=Henzell |first2=Laura |title=The Rough Guide to Jamaica |date=18 August 2015 |publisher=Rough Guides |isbn=978-0241181300 |edition=6th}}</ref> H.

The work reflects the racial tension, economic inequality and desire for self-government felt by Jamaicans and other Caribbean islanders. His creative output also coincided with the search for forms of \"authentic\" Jamaican expression that preceded the independence movement. Above all, though, Dunkley's oeuvre is a singular exploration of a complicated and often-dark personal and cultural identity.<ref name=\"artfix\" />\n\nHe is associated with a group of Jamaican artists known as \"[[The Intuitives]]\". The group includes [[Mallica Reynolds]], David Miller Senior, David Miller Junior, [[Everald Brown]], [[David Pottinger]] and [[Albert Huie]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/jamaicaculture00wils|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/jamaicaculture00wils/page/19 19]|quote=john dunkley artist.|title=Jamaica: The culture|last=Wilson|first=Amber|date=2004|publisher=Crabtree Publishing Company|isbn=9780778793328|language=en}}</ref> His work is generally darker in tone, and has been described as sharing characteristics with [[Wifredo Lam]]'s paintings. Some critics see commonality with the work of French [[Post-Impressionist]] [[Henri Rousseau]].\n\nDunkley was deeply involved in the socio-political issues of his day, in particular the rampant racism that saw him become a [[pan-Africanist]] and an admirer of [[Marcus Garvey]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Simon |first1=Alexandra |title=Work of Jamaican artist John Dunkley on display in New York |url=https://www.caribbeanlifenews.com/stories/2018/11/m-john-dunkley-folk-art-exhibit-2018-10-12-cl.html |website=Caribbean Life |date=27 October 2018 |accessdate=20 December 2018}}</ref> \n\n==Later life==\n\nWhile continuing to ply his trade as a barber, Dunkley maintained his artistic pursuits. Active for little more than a decade before his early death, his output as a painter was small. Less than 50 paintings are known, but they reveal a unique and compelling aesthetic. There is no clearly discernible development in Dunkley's work. Anticipating impending fame, the artist kept his paintings and persisted in refining, even overworking, them.<ref name=\"blog\"/>\n\nMost of the paintings are imagined, [[Surrealism|surrealistic]] landscapes replete with hidden symbolism. The surfaces are delicate and tapestry-like. Fantastic vegetation, trees and shrubs with overblown flowers, are contrasted with bare truncated branches, in a way that encourages the viewer's understanding of them as phallic symbols. A preoccupation with the link between eroticism and death, the [[Freudian]] Eros/Thantos concept, is also in evidence.<ref name=\"diaspora\">{{cite web |title=John Dunkley |url=http://new.diaspora-artists.net/display_item.php?id=635&table=artists&linkphrase=John+Dunkley |website=Diaspora Artists |accessdate=19 December 2018 |archive-date=17 November 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231117144502/http://new.diaspora-artists.net/display_item.php?id=635&table=artists&linkphrase=John+Dunkley |url-status=dead }}</ref> Small mammals, crabs, birds and often spiders with their complex webs, inhabit the gloomy woods. Human figures are rare, though human presence is implied by an occasional house painted in the distance or at the edge of a wood. Dunkley's most persistent motif is the pathway or road, which sometimes pushes through the vegetation to suggest great depth. In \"Back to Nature\" (circa 1939), the path, impressed with footprints, bifurcates to encircle a heart-shaped grave.<ref name=\"blog\"/> \n\nA distinct group of less claustrophobic paintings are thought to be his last. In \"Lonely Road\", \"Springboard\", \"Woman Feeding Fish\" and \"Footbridge\", the typically dense vegetation gives way to more expansive vistas and clearer skies. The backgrounds are white rather than grey. Far fewer elements populate the landscape. In some, the black outlines of sparse vegetation are silhouetted against the sky. Though less confined, the works are still disquieting. Surreal touches, such as the isolated platform in \"Springboard\", leaves pushing up through the cracks in \"Feeding the Fishes\" and the unstable support in \"Footbridge\" contribute to the sense of unease.<ref name=\"blog\"/>\n\nDunkley was inspired occasionally by current events. There is a mixed media piece depicting boxer [[Joe Louis]]. In the \"Good Shepherd\" (circa 1938), populist politician [[Alexander Bustamante]] is shown gathering flocks of sheep, while in the distance a few straggly goats run away.<ref name=\"blog\"/> When the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt administration]] built [[Vernam Field]] at Sandy Gully during [[World War II]],<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Foster |first1=Thomas |title=United States Bases in Jamaica During the 1939-45 War |journal=Stamp Collecting |date=16 July 1970}}</ref> Dunkley made a painting of the president. From a large piece of [[Lignum Vitae]] cut down for the military base, he carved a seated portrait of a proud Jamaican man and named him \"Sandy Gully\".<ref name=\"blog\"/>\n\nDunkley's small body of sculptures, primarily wood-carvings, are less complicated/accomplished than his paintings. In addition to \"Sandy Gully\" (1940), notable works include \"Old Joe\", an intense portrait of a black man clasping his knees while bent in prayer,<ref name=\"blog\"/> and \"Acrobat\", a [[mahogany]] carving of a man contorting himself with his head between his legs and beneath his posterior.<ref name=\"artfix\"/>\n\nDuring his lifetime, Dunkley received some local recognition for his artwork as a result of group exhibitions.<ref name=\"artfix\"/> In 1938, a carving of a reindeer (since destroyed) won a prize at St. George's Exhibition in Kingston. The following year, Dunkley received a bronze medal for \"notable contribution to the art of the world\" at the [[1939 New York World's Fair|New York World's Fair]]. Three works, \"Back to Nature\", \"Jerboa\"  and \"Pastures\" were exhibited at the Institute of Jamaica's 1945 Survey of West Indian Painting, a show that also traveled to [[Canada]]. Four paintings including \"Banana Plantation\" were exhibited in London in 1946.<ref name=\"diaspora\"/> \n\nDunkley was in failing health for many months prior to his death. He passed away at 55 years of age, probably from lung cancer,<ref name=\"rail\"/> on 17 February 1947. His large funeral was attended by both rich and poor.<ref name=\"blog\"/>\n\n==Posthumous fame==\n\nFollowing his death, Dunkley's reputation grew. In 1948, he was honored with a memorial exhibition at the Institute of Jamaica.<ref name=\"diaspora\" /> \n\n=== Relevant  Exhibitions ===\nIn 1951, his painting \"Jerboa\" was shown at the First Caribbean Exhibition in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]]. A retrospective of Dunkley's work, with fellow intuitive artist Henry Daley, was exhibited in 1960 at the Institute of Jamaica. In 1969, the painting \"Diamond Wedding\" was shown at \"Art in Jamaica Since the Thirties\" at [[Spelman College]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. Dunkley was represented by two pieces, \"Jerboa\" and \"Back to Nature\" in the exhibition \"Three Decades of Jamaican Painting\" at Commonwealth Institute Art Gallery in [[London]] (1971). An exhibition of Dunkley's paintings and sculptures was held at the [[National Gallery of Jamaica]], 9 December 1976 to 19 February 1977.<ref name=\"diaspora\" /> With the resurrection of a fair percentage of his oeuvre in the retrospective and a subsequent permanent display of his work, Dunkley regained his position as a true Jamaican master.<ref name=\"blog\" />\n\nFrom 26 May 2017 through 14 January 2018, the [[Pérez Art Museum Miami]] (PAMM) held the first major exhibition of Dunkley's work outside of his native country. ''John Dunkley: Neither Day nor Night'' was composed of forty-five works, paintings from the 1930s and 1940s, as well as rare carved wood and stone figures. A monograph of same title was published on the occasion.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Nawi |first=Diana |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/959594093 |title=John Dunkley : neither day nor night |date=2017 |others=John Dunkley, David Boxer, Olive Senior, Nicole Smythe-Johnson, Pérez Art Museum Miami |isbn=978-3-7913-5610-5 |location=New York, NY |oclc=959594093}}</ref>\n\nThe show traveled to the National Gallery of Jamaica, where it was on display from 29 April 2018 to 29 July 2018, and it was then on display at the [[American Folk Art Museum]] in [[New York City|New York]] from 30 October 2018 to 24 February 2019. <ref name=\"artfix\" /> <ref name=\"archer\" />\n\nIn a ''New York Times'' review about Dunkley's work, critic Roberta Smith states that<blockquote>\"Working in a faded-tapestry palette of mostly black, dark brown and white tinted with green, rose and yellow, he energized his images with disorienting shifts in scale, perspective and form. Bushes and trees suggest large vegetables or flowers; chopped-off tree trunks intimate water pipes, corncobs or phalluses. The branches they sprout are often trees unto themselves. Numerous paths and lanes disappear into dark forests or tunnels while reinforcing the flatness of the canvas.\"<ref>{{Cite news |last=Smith |first=Roberta |date=2019-01-24 |title=John Dunkley, an Outsider Artist Deep in the Heart of Jamaica |language=en-US |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/arts/design/john-dunkley-american-folk-art-museum.html |access-date=2023-05-09 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref> </blockquote>The National Gallery of Jamaica's version contained work not shown at PAMM that explored the themes of tourism, immigration and the emergence of cultural nationalism during Dunkley's lifetime.  \"Daylight Come…Picturing Dunkley’s Jamaica\" served as a complement to \"John Dunkley: Neither Day nor Night.\" It included rare photographs, artifacts and film footage from the turn of the 20th century to the Jamaican Nationalist movement, providing further context to Dunkley's output.<ref>{{cite web |title=Art Exhibition: John Dunkley at the National Gallery of Jamaica |url=https://repeatingislands.com/2018/06/19/art-exhibition-john-dunkley-at-the-national-gallery-of-jamaica/ |website=Repeating Islands |date=19 June 2018 |accessdate=19 December 2018 |archive-date=20 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181220230954/https://repeatingislands.com/2018/06/19/art-exhibition-john-dunkley-at-the-national-gallery-of-jamaica/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dunkley, John}}\n[[Category:1891 births]]\n[[Category:1947 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Westmoreland Parish]]\n[[Category:20th-century Jamaican painters]]\n[[Category:20th-century Jamaican sculptors]]\n[[Category:20th-century male artists]]\n[[Category:Outsider artists]]"

The high beams will be lasers, though the low beams will be [[light-emitting diode]]s. The car maker says that their high beams have a 500-meter range, which is roughly twice the distance of LED high beams. Lasers are expensive though. Lasers are smaller, brighter and more energy efficient than LED headlamps. Their laser headlamps use less than half the energy of LEDs. Laser diodes can emit 170 [[Luminous efficacy|lumens per watt]], while LEDs generate only 100 lumens. Lasers are sensitive to heat but that has not stopped their production for vehicles. Laser technology is not as advanced compared with LEDs, which have been around for decades.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sedgwick |first=David |date=January 7, 2014 |title=BMW, Audi will introduce laser headlamps this year |url=http://europe.autonews.com/article/20140107/ANE/301109994/bmw-audi-will-introduce-laser-headlamps-this-year#axzz2plLg0bce |website=Automotive News Europe |access-date=November 26, 2022}}</ref>\n\n==== 2015 ====\nThe 2015 International CES was held during the week January 6–9, 2015, in the Las Vegas Convention Center, Las Vegas, Nevada, United States.

Her parents had arrived the day before, after leaving [[Loynton|Loynton Hall]] on an ancestral estate in Staffordshire, as the guests of the reverend Tom Burne. The family moved to Summerhill, [[Edgmond]], in Shropshire<ref name=dickins/> in 1854, having exhausted their welcome. Her father received debilitating injuries in a hunting accident several years later, causing to the family to move as the burden of his care was shared amongst the extended Burne family. She was sent to Loynton Hall for holidays, which was now occupied by mainly unmarried aunts who reported she was undisciplined. Lotty, as she was called, suffered several serious illnesses during her early years, conditions of ill health and obesity would impede her physical well-being throughout her life.\n\n==Works==\nBurne's works include the large collection, ''Shropshire Folklore'',<ref>{{cite journal|author=Watkins, M. G.|title=Review of ''Shropshire Folk-Lore'', Part I, edited by Charlotte S. Burne|date=16 June 1883|journal=The Academy|volume=23|issue=580|page=416|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.c2650235;view=1up;seq=430}}</ref> and preparation of the second edition of the Folklore Society's official ''Handbook of Folklore'', she also contributed over seventy articles and reviews to its journals. Her appointment to various positions in the Society was unusual, having been previously held by its London members, and she was the first woman to become President or editor of its publications. A small amount of other material was published in newspapers and magazines.\n\nDespite the firsts, penetrating gender and regional barriers, and serving the society for forty years, during a well-documented period of its history, details of her life and works are inadequately noticed. Some correspondence of Burne with leading members [[Alice Bertha Gomme|Alice Bertha]] and [[George Laurence Gomme|G. Laurence Gomme]] is contained in the Society's archives, but her personal papers seem to have been destroyed. A vague and inaccurate portrait of her life and works was given in references to her in [[Richard Dorson]]'s history of the British folklorists (1968); J. C. Burne, a great nephew, drew on letters and recollections of her family for a \"tactful biography\" published in 1975. An obituary was published by [[E. Sidney Hartland]].\n\nBurne's interest in history and antiquities, and subsequently [[folk-lore]], was probably fostered by her mother. She was prompted by those connected to the family to compile a genealogical history of the Mildmay family, her first manuscript for this still exists, and the editing of the poet [[Richard Barnfield]] works. Her talents as an editor were initially recognised in [[Robert William Eyton|R. W. Eyton]]'s acknowledgements in his ''Doomsday Studies'' and the subsequent accolades in a local newspaper.\n\nIn 1875 Burne became friendly with [[Georgina Frederica Jackson]], who was collecting material for her ''Shropshire Word Book'' (1879) and its companion work with the provisional title of \"Folk-lore Gleanings\". Jackson's demise led Burne to take over her material, adding her own collection of tales to produce ''Shropshire Folk-Lore: A Sheaf of Gleanings'', her first major work. This exhaustive collection was well received and continues to be favourably viewed, her obituary gave the remark \"the first time the folklore of a county was published—at any rate in a form so complete and so scientific\" (Hartland, 1923) and later folklorist [[Katharine Mary Briggs|Katharine Briggs]] describing it as \"perhaps the best county folklore book we possess as well as the most monumental\".\n\nIn the early 1890s she resided at Pyebirch, [[Eccleshall, Staffordshire|Eccleshall]], in north Staffordshire.  There she collaborated the local folklorist and folk-song collector Miss Alice Annie Keary, of [[Stoke-on-Trent]].  Together they spent three years circa 1890-1893 collecting materials locally in north Staffordshire.  While a number of joint papers were published, Burne moved to [[Cheltenham]] circa 1894, and the project failed to be realised in book form.\n\nBurne's approach to the systematic collection of folklore gave emphasis to classification of material, and the means by which it was obtained. She wrote two essays on collection, and contributed to an ongoing discourse on fieldwork, proposing that the way she interviewed produced material uncorrupted by cautious retelling or embellishment. She also promoted the importance of documenting the historical and regional context of the tales, and accounting for the substitution and changes in the characters and incidents of these; their influence by economic, local, and personal factors is indicated in her earliest works and developed in her later articles and essays.\n\n==References==\n{{wikisource author}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Internet Archive author |sname=Charlotte Sophia Burne}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Burne, Charlotte Sophia}}\n[[Category:Folklore writers]]\n[[Category:English folklorists]]\n[[Category:British women folklorists]]\n[[Category:1923 deaths]]\n[[Category:1850 births]]\n[[Category:Writers from Shropshire]]\n[[Category:Presidents of the Folklore Society]]\n[[Category:19th-century English women writers]]\n[[Category:19th-century English writers]]\n[[Category:20th-century English women writers]]"

Simply listed as \"World\" on the album, the subtitle \"The Price of Love\" was added for the single release, as it is repeated during the chorus. A 7:34 dance remix of the track by [[Paul Oakenfold]], called the \"Perfecto mix\", was included on many releases of the single and was used for an alternate edit of the video.\n\n==Music video==\nThe music video was originally shot in April 1996. It was used for both the original version and an edit of the Perfecto remix of the song. Directed by [[Baillie Walsh]] and shot in [[Cannes]] with only 4 long [[steadicam]] shots, the video features the camera slowly journeying from the [[pier]] of the beach club of the exclusive luxury [[InterContinental Carlton Cannes Hotel|Carlton Hotel]] into the hotel itself, lingering on the faces of hotel guests. \n\nIt features the band only fleetingly – [[Peter Hook]] sits at a table on the beach club restaurant, [[Bernard Sumner]] stands overlooking the sea, and [[Stephen Paul David Morris|Stephen Morris]] and [[Gillian Gilbert]] pose for a photograph outside the [[Carlton Hotel, Cannes|Carlton Hotel]]; the photographer on the esplanade striking the 'Elvis' pose is percussionist David Armstrong, who was a session musician on the 'Republic' album.

Lee]] at the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] in 1863.\n\nHooker had served in the [[Seminole Wars]] and the [[Mexican–American War]], receiving three brevet promotions, before resigning from the Army. At the start of the Civil War, he joined the Union side as a brigadier general, distinguishing himself at [[Battle of Williamsburg|Williamsburg]], [[Battle of Antietam|Antietam]] and [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]], after which he was given command of the [[Army of the Potomac]].\n\nHis ambitious plan for Chancellorsville was thwarted by Lee's bold move in dividing his army and routing a Union corps, as well as by mistakes on the part of Hooker's subordinate generals and his own loss of nerve. The defeat handed Lee the initiative, which allowed him to travel north to Gettysburg.\n\nHooker was kept in command, but when General Halleck and Lincoln declined his request for reinforcements, he resigned. [[George G. Meade]] was appointed to command the Army of the Potomac three days before Gettysburg.\n\nHooker returned to combat in November 1863, helping to relieve the besieged Union Army at [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], and continuing in the Western Theater under Maj. Gen. [[William T. Sherman]], but departed in protest before the end of the [[Atlanta Campaign]] when he was passed over for promotion.\n\nHooker became known as \"Fighting Joe\" following a journalist's clerical error, and the nickname stuck. His personal reputation was as a hard-drinking ladies' man, and his headquarters was known for parties and gambling.\n\n==Early years==\nHooker was born in [[Hadley, Massachusetts]], the grandson of a [[Captain (Continental Army)|captain]] in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. He was of entirely [[English people|English]] ancestry, all of whom had been in [[New England]] since the early 1600s.<ref>''Homes of the Massachusetts ancestors of Major General Joseph Hooker'', By Isaac Paul Gragg{{ISBN?}} {{page?|date=September 2022}}</ref> His initial schooling was at the local [[Hopkins Academy]].

He served in the [[Mexican–American War]] in staff positions in the campaigns of both [[Zachary Taylor]] and [[Winfield Scott]].

He commanded a [[brigade]] and then [[division (military)|division]] around Washington, D.C., as part of the effort to organize and train the new [[Army of the Potomac]], under [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[George B. McClellan]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/topics/american-civil-war/joseph-hooker|title=Joseph Hooker|date=30 April 2019 }}</ref>\n\n===1862===\n\n[[File: Major General Joseph Hooker of General Staff U.S. Volunteers Infantry Regiment in uniform) - From photographic negative in Brady's National Portrait Gallery LCCN2016646189.jpg|thumb|right|Major General Joseph Hooker, 1862. From the Liljenquist Family Collection of Civil War Photographs, Prints and Photographs Division, [[Library of Congress]]. Photograph by [[Mathew Brady]]]]\n\nIn the [[Peninsula Campaign]] of 1862, Hooker commanded the 2nd Division of the [[III Corps (Union Army)|III Corps]] and made a good name for himself as a combat leader who handled himself well and aggressively sought out the key points on battlefields. He led his division with distinction at [[Battle of Williamsburg|Williamsburg]] and at [[Battle of Seven Pines|Seven Pines]]. Hooker's division did not play a major role in the [[Seven Days Battles]], although he and fellow division commander [[Phil Kearny]] tried unsuccessfully to urge McClellan to counterattack the Confederates. He chafed at the cautious generalship of McClellan and openly criticized his failure to capture [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]. Of his commander, Hooker said, \"He is not only not a soldier, but he does not know what soldiership is.\" The Peninsula cemented two further reputations of Hooker's: his devotion to the welfare and morale of his men,  and his hard-drinking social life, even on the battlefield.\n\nOn July 26, Hooker was promoted to major general, ranked from May 5. During the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]], the III Corps was sent to reinforce [[John Pope (general)|John Pope]]'s [[Army of Virginia]]. Following Second Bull Run, Hooker replaced [[Irvin McDowell]] as commander of the Army of Virginia's III Corps, which soon redesignated the I Corps of the Army of the Potomac. During the Maryland Campaign, Hooker led the I Corps at [[Battle of South Mountain|South Mountain]] and at Antietam, his corps launched the first assault of the bloodiest day in American history, driving south into the corps of [[Lt. Gen. (CSA)|Lt. Gen.]] [[Stonewall Jackson]], where they fought each other to a standstill. Hooker, aggressive and inspiring to his men, left the battle early in the morning with a foot wound. He asserted that the battle would have been a decisive Union victory if he had managed to stay on the field, but General McClellan's caution once again failed the Northern troops and Lee's much smaller army eluded destruction. With his patience at an end, President Lincoln replaced McClellan with Maj. Gen. [[Ambrose Burnside]]. Although Hooker had criticized McClellan persistently, the latter was apparently unaware of it and in early October, shortly before his termination, had recommended that Hooker receive a promotion to brigadier general in the regular army. The War Department promptly acted on this recommendation, and Hooker received his brigadier's commission to rank from September 20. This promotion ensured that he would remain a general after the war was over, retire a general, and be entitled to a general's pay and pension.\n\nThe December 1862 [[Battle of Fredericksburg]] was another Union debacle. Upon recovering from his foot wound, Hooker was briefly made commander of [[V Corps (Union Army)|V Corps]] but was then promoted to \"Grand Division\" command, with a command that consisted of both III and V Corps. Hooker derided Burnside's plan to assault the fortified heights behind the city, deeming them \"preposterous\". His Grand Division (particularly V Corps) suffered serious losses in fourteen futile assaults ordered by Burnside over Hooker's protests. Burnside followed up this battle with the humiliating [[Mud March (American Civil War)|Mud March]] in January and Hooker's criticism of his commander bordered on formal insubordination. He described Burnside as a \"wretch ... of blundering sacrifice.\" Burnside planned a wholesale purge of his subordinates, including Hooker, and drafted an order for the president's approval. He stated that Hooker was \"unfit to hold an important commission during a crisis like the present.\" But Lincoln's patience had again run out and he removed Burnside instead.\n\n===Army of the Potomac===\n[[File:Hooker joseph.jpg|thumb|Major General Joseph Hooker, <br>ca. 1860–ca. 1865]]\nLincoln appointed Hooker to command of the [[Army of the Potomac]] on January 26, 1863. Some members of the army saw this move as inevitable, given Hooker's reputation for aggressive fighting, something sorely lacking in his predecessors. During the \"Mud March\" Hooker was quoted by a ''New York Times'' army correspondent as saying that \"Nothing would go right until we had a dictator, and the sooner the better.\"<ref>Sears, ''Chancellorsville'', p. 21.</ref> Lincoln wrote a letter to the newly appointed general, part of which stated,\n\n{{Quote|I have heard, in such a way as to believe it, of your recently saying that both the Army and the Government needed a Dictator. Of course, it was not for this, but in spite of it, that I have given you the command. Only those generals who gain success can set up dictators. What I now ask of you is military success, and I will risk the dictatorship.<ref>Sears, ''Chancellorsville'', pp. 57–58.</ref>}}\n\nDuring the spring of 1863, Hooker established a reputation as an outstanding administrator and restored the morale of his soldiers, which had plummeted to a new low under Burnside. Among his changes were fixes to the daily diet of the troops, camp sanitary changes, improvements and accountability of the quartermaster system, addition of and monitoring of company cooks, several hospital reforms, and an improved furlough system (one man per company by turn, 10 days each).<ref>Catton, pp. 141–147.</ref> He created the [[Bureau of Military Information]], which was the first all-source intelligence organization employed by the U.S. military.<ref>Tsouras, pp. 1–2.</ref>  He also implemented corps badges as a means of identifying units during battle or when marching and to instill unit pride in the men. Other orders addressed the need to stem rising desertion (one from Lincoln combined with incoming mail review, the ability to shoot deserters, and better camp picket lines), more and better drills, stronger officer training, and for the first time, combining the federal cavalry into a single corps.<ref>Catton, pp. 141–147.</ref> The corps badge idea was suggested by Hooker's chief of staff, [[Daniel Butterfield]]. <ref>(Sears, ''Chancellorsville'', p. 72).</ref> Hooker said of his revived army:\n\n{{Quote|I have the finest army on the planet. I have the finest army the sun ever shone on. ... If the enemy does not run, God help them. May God have mercy on General Lee, for I will have none.}}\n\nAlso during this winter, Hooker made several high-level command changes, including with his corps commanders. Both \"Left Grand Division\" commander Maj. Gen. [[William B. Franklin]], who vowed that he would not serve under Hooker, and [[II Corps (Union Army)|II Corps]] commander Maj. Gen. [[Edwin Vose Sumner]] was relieved of command, on Burnside's recommendation, in the same order appointing Hooker to command. The [[IX Corps (Union Army)|IX Corps]] was a potential source of embarrassment or friction within the army because it was Burnside's old corps, so it was detached as a separate organization and sent to the [[Virginia Peninsula]] under the command of Brig. Gen. [[William Farrar Smith|William F. \"Baldy\" Smith]], former commander of [[VI Corps (Union Army)|VI Corps]]. (Both Franklin and Smith were considered suspect by Hooker because of their previous political maneuvering against Burnside and on behalf of McClellan.)<ref>Catton, p. 147; Sears, ''Chancellorsville'', p. 61.</ref>\n\nFor the important position of chief of staff, Hooker asked the War Department to send him Brig. Gen. [[Charles Pomeroy Stone|Charles Stone]], however, this was denied. Stone had been relieved, arrested, and imprisoned for his role in the [[Battle of Ball's Bluff]] in the fall of 1861, despite the lack of any trial. Stone did not receive a command upon his release, mostly due to political pressures, which left him militarily exiled and disgraced. Army of the Potomac historian and author [[Bruce Catton]] termed this request by Hooker \"a strange and seemingly uncharacteristic thing\" and \"one of the most interesting things he ever did.\"<ref>Catton, pp. 147–149.</ref> Hooker never explained why he asked for Stone, but Catton believed:\n\n{{Quote|[Hooker] laid schemes and calculations aside and for one brief moment stood up as a straightforward soldier who would defy politics and politicians. ... It is a point to remember because to speak up for General Stone took moral courage, a quality which Joe Hooker is rarely accused of possessing.<ref>Catton, p. 149.</ref>}}\n\nDespite this, Fighting Joe would set a very bad example for the conduct of generals and their staff and subordinates. His headquarters in [[Falmouth, Virginia]], was described by cavalry officer [[Charles Francis Adams, Jr.|Charles F. Adams, Jr.]], as being a combination of a \"bar-room and a [[brothel]]\".<ref>Foote, pp. 233–234</ref> He built a network of loyal political cronies that included Maj. Gen. [[Daniel Butterfield|Dan Butterfield]] for chief of staff, and the notorious [[political general]], Maj. Gen. [[Daniel E. Sickles]], for command of the [[III Corps (Union Army)|III Corps]].\n\n====Chancellorsville====\n[[File:FightinJoeHookeronMount.jpg|thumb|General \"Fightin' Joe\" Hooker]]\n[[File:GeneralJoeHooker&Staff.jpg|thumb|Union General Joseph Hooker (seated 2nd to right) and his staff, 1863]]\nHooker's plan for the spring and summer campaign was both elegant and promising. He first planned to send his cavalry corps deep into the enemy's rear, disrupting supply lines and distracting him from the main attack. He would pin down Robert E. Lee's much smaller army at Fredericksburg while taking the large bulk of the Army of the Potomac on a flanking march to strike Lee in his rear. Defeating Lee, he could move on to seize Richmond. Unfortunately for Hooker and the Union, the execution of his plan did not match the elegance of the plan itself. The cavalry raid was conducted cautiously by its commander, [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brig. Gen.]] [[George Stoneman]], and met none of its objectives. The flanking march went well enough, achieving strategic surprise, but when he attempted to advance with three columns, Stonewall Jackson's surprise attack on May 1 pushed Hooker back and caused him to withdraw his troops. From there, Hooker pulled his army back to Chancellorsville and waited for Lee to attack. Lee audaciously split his smaller army in two to deal with both parts of Hooker's army. Then, he split again, sending Stonewall Jackson's corps on its own flanking march, striking Hooker's exposed right flank and routing the Union [[XI Corps (Union Army)|XI Corps]]. The Army of the Potomac dropped into a purely defensive mode and eventually was forced to retreat.\n\nThe [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] has been called \"Lee's perfect battle\" because of his ability to vanquish a much larger foe through audacious tactics. Part of Hooker's failure can be attributed to an encounter with a cannonball; while he was standing on the porch of his headquarters, the missile struck a wooden column against which he was leaning, initially knocking him senseless, and then putting him out of action for the rest of the day with a [[concussion]]. Despite his incapacitation, he refused entreaties to turn over temporary command of the army to his second-in-command, Maj. Gen. [[Darius N. Couch]]. Several of his subordinate generals, including Couch and Maj. Gen. [[Henry Warner Slocum|Henry W. Slocum]], openly questioned Hooker's command decisions. Couch was so disgusted that he refused to ever serve under Hooker again. Political winds blew strongly in the following weeks as generals maneuvered to overthrow Hooker or to position themselves if Lincoln decided on his own to do so.\n\nRobert E. Lee once again began an invasion of the North, in June 1863, and Lincoln urged Hooker to pursue and defeat him. Hooker's initial plan was to seize Richmond instead, but Lincoln immediately vetoed that idea, so the Army of the Potomac began to march north, attempting to locate Lee's Army of Northern Virginia as it slipped down the [[Shenandoah Valley]] into [[Pennsylvania]]. Hooker's mission was first to protect Washington, D.C., and [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] and second to intercept and defeat Lee. Unfortunately, Lincoln was losing any remaining confidence he had in Hooker. Hooker's senior officers expressed to Lincoln their lack of confidence in Hooker, as did [[Henry W. Halleck]], Lincoln's General-in-chief.<ref>Sears, Stephen W.,'' Gettysburg'', Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company, Boston & New York, 2003, p. 19 {{ISBN?}}</ref> When Hooker got into a dispute with Army headquarters over the status of defensive forces in [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]], he impulsively offered his resignation in protest, which was quickly accepted by Lincoln and Halleck.<ref name=\" Hooker resignation\" >{{cite web |url=https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Hooker_Joseph_1814-1879#start_entry |author= Patrick A.

Joseph Hooker... for the skill, energy, and endurance which first covered Washington and Baltimore from the meditated blow of the advancing and powerful army of rebels led by General Robert E. Lee....''\"</ref> but the glory would go to Meade. Hooker's tenure as head of the Army of the Potomac had lasted 5 months.\n\n===Western Theater===\n[[File: Mrs. Joseph Hooker (Olivia Groesbeck).jpg|thumb|Olivia Groesbeck Hooker]]\n[[File: Hooker at Lookout Mountain.jpg|thumb|left|Hooker and his staff at Lookout Mountain]]\nHooker's military career was not ended by his poor performance in the summer of 1863. He went on to regain a reputation as a solid corps commander when he was transferred with the [[XI Corps (Union Army)|XI]] and [[XXII Corps (Union Army)|XII Corps]] of the Army of the Potomac westward to reinforce the [[Army of the Cumberland]] around [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. Hooker was in command at the [[Battle of Lookout Mountain]], playing an important role in [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lt. Gen.]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s decisive victory at the [[Battle of Chattanooga III|Battle of Chattanooga]]. He was brevetted to major general in the [[Regular Army (United States)|regular army]] for his success at Chattanooga, but he was disappointed to find that Grant's official report of the battle credited [[William Tecumseh Sherman]]'s contribution over Hooker's.\n\nHooker led his corps (now designated the [[XX Corps (Union Army)|XX Corps]]) competently in the 1864 [[Atlanta Campaign]] under Sherman but when [[Army of the Tennessee]] commander [[James B. McPherson]] was killed in July during the battles around Atlanta, Sherman appointed XI Corps commander [[Oliver O. Howard]] to command the army instead. Hooker was offended at this gesture as he outranked Howard and had blamed him for the defeat at Chancellorsville. He also had very poor relations with XII Corps commander [[Henry W. Slocum]] ever since that battle and Slocum was relieved at being reassigned and sent to command the [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]] garrison. Sherman did not have a very positive opinion of Hooker and readily accepted his resignation. Upon hearing of Hooker's protests at being turned down for army command despite his seniority, Grant remarked \"A major general is only entitled to command of a division.\" Hooker's biographer reports that there were numerous stories indicating that Abraham Lincoln attempted to intercede with Sherman, urging that Hooker be appointed to command the Army of the Tennessee, but Sherman threatened to resign if the president insisted. However, due to \"obvious gaps\" in the [[Official Records of the American Civil War|Official Records]], the story cannot be verified.<ref>Hebert, p. 285.</ref>\n\nAfter leaving Georgia, Hooker commanded the [[Northern Department (Union Army)|Northern Department]] (comprising the states of [[Michigan]], [[Ohio]], [[Indiana]], and [[Illinois]]), headquartered in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], from October 1, 1864, until the end of the war.<ref name=Eicher304/> While in Cincinnati he married Olivia Groesbeck, sister of [[U.S. Congressman|Congressman]] [[William S. Groesbeck]].\n\n==Final years==\n[[File:Joseph Hooker outside MA Statehouse.jpg|thumb|Hooker's equestrian statue at [[Massachusetts State House]]]]\n[[File:2491869315 Hooker.jpg|thumb|upright|General Hooker's Quickstep, sheet music, 19th century]]\n\nAfter the war, Hooker led [[Funeral and burial of Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln's funeral procession]] in [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]] on May 4, 1865. He served in command of the [[Department of the East]] and [[Department of the Lakes]] following the war. His postbellum life was marred by poor health and he was partially paralyzed by a stroke. He was mustered out of the volunteer service on September 1, 1866, and retired from the U.S. Army on October 15, 1868, with the [[Regular Army (United States)|regular army]] rank of major general. He died on October 31, 1879, while on a visit to [[Garden City, New York]], and is buried in Spring Grove Cemetery, [[Cincinnati, Ohio]],<ref name=Eicher304/> his wife's hometown.\n\n==Legacy==\nHooker was popularly known as \"Fighting Joe\" Hooker, a nickname he regretted deeply; he said, \"People will think I am a highwayman or a bandit.\"<ref>\"Hooker's Comments on Chancellorsville\", ''Battles and Leaders'', Vol. III, p. 217.</ref> When a newspaper dispatch arrived in New York during the Peninsula Campaign, a typographical error changed the entry \"Fighting – Joe Hooker Attacks Rebels\" to remove the dash and the name stuck.<ref>Foote, p. 234.</ref> Robert E. Lee occasionally referred to him as \"Mr. F. J. Hooker\" in a mildly sarcastic jab at his opponent.\n\nHooker's reputation as a hard-drinking ladies' man was established through rumors in the pre-Civil War Army and has been cited by a number of popular histories.<ref>See, for example, Catton, p. 134, \"a profane, hard-drinking soldier\", and Foote, p. 233.</ref> Biographer Walter H. Hebert describes the general's personal habits as the \"subject of much debate\"<ref name=Hebert65>Hebert, p. 65.</ref> although there was little debate in the popular opinion of the time. His men parodied Hooker in the popular war song ''Marching Along''. The lines\n\n{{Quote|McClellan's our leader,<br />He's gallant and strong}}\n\nwere replaced by\n\n{{Quote|Joe Hooker's our leader,<br />He takes his whiskey strong.<ref name=Hebert65/>}}\n\nHistorian [[Stephen W. Sears]], however, states that there is no basis for the claims that Hooker was a heavy drinker or that he was ever intoxicated on the battlefield.<ref>Sears, ''Chancellorsville'', pp. 54–55, 60, 505–506.</ref>\n\n{{anchor|prostitute}}\nThere is a popular legend that \"hooker\" as a slang term for a prostitute is derived from his last name<ref>Hebert, p. vii.</ref> because of parties and a lack of military discipline at his headquarters near the [[Murder Bay]] district of Washington, DC. Some versions of the legend claim that the band of prostitutes that followed his division was derisively referred to as \"General Hooker's Army\" or \"Hooker's Brigade\".<ref>See, for example, [http://www.loudounhistory.org/history/loudoun-cw-chronology.htm Loudoun County, Virginia, history website].</ref> However, the term \"hooker\" was used in print as early as 1845, years before Hooker was a public figure,<ref>[http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-hoo4.htm World Wide Words website]</ref> and is likely derived from the concentration of prostitutes around the shipyards and ferry terminal of the [[Lower East Side#Corlear's Hook|Corlear's Hook]] area of [[Manhattan]] in the early to middle 19th century, who came to be referred to as \"hookers\".<ref>[[Edwin G. Burrows|Burrows, Edwin G.]] & [[Mike Wallace (historian)|Mike Wallace]]. ''[[Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898]]''.  New York: Oxford University Press, 1999. p. 484</ref> The prevalence of the Hooker legend may have been at least partly responsible for the popularity of the term.<ref>[http://www.word-detective.com/052003.html The Word Detective website, May 20, 2003, issue] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508140613/http://www.word-detective.com/052003.html |date=May 8, 2008 }}.</ref> There is some evidence that an area in Washington, DC, known for prostitution during the Civil War, was referred to as \"Hooker's Division\".

Sometimes the trick is done with a piece of string, a handkerchief, or a [[turban]] instead of an actual rope.\n\n== Method ==\nThere are many variations on the cut and restore rope trick, but most or all are variations on three basic methods.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hay|first=Henry|title=Cyclopedia of Magic|date=1949|pages=396|isbn=0-486-21808-2}}</ref>\n\nThe first method involves using [[sleight of hand]] to make the viewers believe that the rope is being cut at the middle, but really it is being cut close to the end. The result is a piece of rope nearly as long as the original and the viewers won't notice the slight change in length.\n\nThe second method involves introducing a short piece of rope of the same type as the main rope, and cutting that instead. This can be accomplished by many sleight of hand tricks but attaching it to the main rope disguised as the loop of a knot is the most common method. When the performer removes the knot, the original rope is completely uncut.<ref name=\"mm\"/>\n\nThe third method involves gimmicked ropes that can literally be rejoined with the use of adhesives or some other method. Usually, the gimmicked ends of the rope are the original two ends, so each segment is 180 degrees from where it started, with the freshly cut portions on the end.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cut And Restore Rope Trick}}\n[[Category:Magic tricks]]\n\n\n{{magic-stub}}"

This system uses certain diagnostic spectral lines to estimate the [[surface gravity]] of a star, hence determining its size relative to its mass.  Larger stars are more luminous at a given temperature and can now be grouped into bands of differing luminosity.<ref name=geisler>{{cite journal|bibcode=1984PASP...96..723G|title=Luminosity classification with the Washington system|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific|volume=96|pages=723|last1=Geisler|first1=D.|year=1984|doi=10.1086/131411|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nThe luminosity differences between stars are most apparent at low temperatures, where giant stars are much brighter than main-sequence stars.  Supergiants have the lowest surface gravities and hence are the largest and brightest at a particular temperature.\n\nThe ''Yerkes'' or ''Morgan-Keenan'' (MK) classification system<ref name=mk>{{cite journal|bibcode=1973ARA&A..11...29M|title=Spectral Classification|journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=11|pages=29–50|last1=Morgan|first1=W.

It groups stars into five main luminosity groups designated by [[roman numerals]]:\n* I [[supergiant]];\n* II [[bright giant]];\n* III [[Giant (star)|giant]];\n* IV [[subgiant]];\n* V [[Dwarf (star)|dwarf]] ([[main sequence]]).\n\nSpecific to supergiants, the luminosity class is further divided into normal supergiants of class Ib and brightest supergiants of class Ia.  The intermediate class Iab is also used.  Exceptionally bright, low surface gravity, stars with strong indications of mass loss may be designated by luminosity class 0 (zero) although this is rarely seen.<ref>{{cite journal|bibcode=1992A&A...263..123P|title=Photometry of yellow semiregular variables – HR 8752 (= V509 Cassiopeiae)|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=263|pages=123|last1=Percy|first1=J.

During his early career, he played lower league football with [[Palamós CF]] and [[RCD Espanyol]]'s [[RCD Espanyol B|B team]]. He subsequently represented [[Levante UD]] and [[Xerez CD]], with both clubs competing in the [[Segunda División|second division]].\n\nAfter five seasons in [[Andalusia]], Autet signed with [[Sporting de Gijón]] for the [[2007–08 Segunda División|2007–08 season]], being an instrumental figure in the side's promotion to [[La Liga]].

The British Columbia government's [[BC Names]] system, a subdivision of [[GeoBC]], defines a land district as \"a territorial division with legally defined boundaries for administrative purposes\".<ref name=bcgnis/>  All land titles and surveys use the Land District system as the primary point of reference, and entries in BC Names for placenames and geographical objects are so listed.\n\n==Description==\nThis land district is named for the city of [[New Westminster]], which at the time of its creation was the capital of the Mainland Colony.  [[Greater Vancouver]], the [[Fraser Valley]], the [[Sunshine Coast (British Columbia)|Sunshine Coast]] and the Highway 99 corridor up to and including the [[Resort Municipality of Whistler]], are all within this land district, as well as [[Savary Island|Savary]], [[Raza Island|Raza]], and [[East Redonda Island|East]] and [[West Redonda Island]]s.  Also included are the settlements of [[Skookumchuck Hot Springs]] (Skatin) and [[Port Douglas, British Columbia|Port Douglas]] on the lower [[Lillooet River]], Long Island, which is a large island in the middle or [[Harrison Lake]], and the [[Harrison Hot Springs|Village of Harrison Hot Springs]], the western half of the [[District of Kent]], and almost all of [[Chilliwack|City of Chilliwack]].\n\nTo the north of the New Westminster Land District are Range 1 Coast Land District and the [[Lillooet Land District]], to its east is the Yale Division Yale Land District and for the small portion of its boundary within the Lillooet Ranges, the Kamloops Division Yale Land District.\n\n===Boundary===\nThe land district's southern boundary lies along part of the international boundary between BC Canada and the [[United States|US]] [[Washington (state)|state of Washington]]. The western end of the land district's southern boundary meets the centre of the [[Strait of Georgia]] where it turns along the midline until it diverges to follow [[Malaspina Strait]], bypasses [[Texada Island]] which has its own separate [[Texada Land District|land district]], then rejoins the midline of the Strait of Georgia approximately midway between [[Comox, British Columbia|Comox]] and [[Powell River, British Columbia|Powell River]] to a point south of [[Hernando Island]], then traversing the mouth of [[Desolation Sound]] following [[Calm Channel]] between [[Cortes Island]] to the west and West Redonda and Raza Islands to [[Pryce Channel]], then following that channel and [[Homfray Channel]] to 51 degree 14 minutes north, from whence it proceeds eastward, other than two small variances around certain land parcels in the area of Homfray Channel and the [[Soo River]], to the summit of the [[Garibaldi Ranges]] just south of [[Mount Currie (British Columbia)|Mount Currie]] to a point southwest of [[In-SHUCK-ch Mountain]] (Gunsight Peak), then eastward via roughly 50 degrees 7 minutes north latitude to the divide of the [[Lillooet Ranges]], following that for a short distance, then south via an irregular line to [[Harrison Lake]], meeting that lake's shoreline northwest of the mouth of [[Big Silver Creek]] (aka Big Silver River) and following the lake south so as to include [[Long Island (British Columbia)|Long Island]] but exclude [[Echo Island]].\n\nUpon reaching the foot of Harrison Lake, the boundary of the land district proceeds southward so as to include the Village of [[Harrison Hot Springs]] and to bisect the [[District of Kent]], excluding the town of [[Agassiz, British Columbia|Agassiz]], roughly along 121 degree 17 minutes west longitude, to a point east of [[Rosedale, British Columbia|Rosedale]] to roughly 49 degrees 11 minutes north latitude, west a short distance to 121 degrees 47 minutes 38 seconds west longitude to roughly 49 degrees 10 minutes 32 seconds north latitude, east along that line which corresponds to Nevin Road to 121 degrees 9 minutes 7 second west and following that line south to 49 degrees 9 minutes 40 seconds north latitude, where it goes a short distance west to roughly 121 degrees 47 minutes 25 seconds west longitude, then south along that line to meet the eastern end of the land district boundary that lies along part of the international boundary.<ref>[http://webmaps.gov.bc.ca/imf5/imf.jsp?site=olc British Columbia Online Cadastre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208132049/http://webmaps.gov.bc.ca/imf5/imf.jsp?site=olc |date=8 December 2009 }}  To use this system to view Land District boundaries, pan or zoom to the approximate location, or use [Find Location tab] to pick a Land District by name.

        "content": "{{short description|Overview of the psychological aspects of childhood obesity}}\n'''[[Childhood obesity]]''' is defined as a [[body mass index]] (BMI) at or above the 96th percentile for children of the same age and sex. It can cause a variety of health problems, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart disease, diabetes, breathing problems, sleeping problems, and joint problems later in life.<ref>[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (2012, April 27). Basics about childhood obesity. ''Centers for Disease Control and Prevention''. Retrieved from https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/childhood/basics.html.</ref> Children who are obese are at a greater risk for social and psychological problems as well, such as peer victimization, increased levels of aggression, and low self-esteem. Many environmental and social factors have been shown to correlate with childhood obesity, and researchers are attempting to use this knowledge to help prevent and treat the condition. When implemented early, certain forms of behavioral and psychological treatment can help children regain and/or maintain a healthy weight.\n\n== Environmental factors ==\n\n=== Television and advertisements ===\n{{further|Adolescents and food marketing}}\n[[Childhood obesity in the United States|Childhood obesity has increased drastically in the US]] in the past 60&nbsp;years, and studies show that in that time, there has been an increase in the amount of time spent watching television. In the 1950s two percent of households owned television sets, and 40&nbsp;years later, 98% of households owned at least 1 television set. Current data reveals that, between the ages of 2 and 17&nbsp;years, on average children spend more than 3&nbsp;years of their lives watching television.<ref name=\"Robinson\">{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = T | year = 1998 | title = Does television cause childhood obesity?. | journal = [[The Journal of the American Medical Association]] | volume = 279 | issue = 12| pages = 959–960 | doi=10.1001/jama.279.12.959| pmid = 9544774 }}</ref> Unhealthy food advertisements correlate with childhood obesity rates. This supports the theory that watching too much television is “one of the most easily modifiable causes of obesity among children.”<ref name=\"Robinson\" />\nConsequentially, there has been an increase in children and adolescents’ exposure to food advertisements. The majority of advertisements targeted at children promote food with minimal nutritional value, such as candy (32% of all children's ads), cereal (31%), and fast-food restaurants (9%).<ref name=\"Kunkel\">{{cite journal | last1 = Kunkel | first1 = D. | last2 = Gantz | first2 = W. | year = 1992 | title = Children | journal = Journal of Communication | volume = 42 | issue = 3| pages = 134–152 | doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1992.tb00803.x}}</ref> In 1997 US food manufacturers spent $7&nbsp;billion on product advertising.

They also specified the ways in which television viewing may affect weight in children and adolescents: severe decreases in physical activity and an increase in the desire for and consumption of unhealthy foods.<ref name=\"Dietz\">{{cite journal | last1 = Dietz | first1 = W.

Even brief exposure to televised food commercials can influence preschool children's food preferences; young children may not be able to distinguish advertisements from their regular programming, and they may not understand that advertisements are meant to persuade while shows are meant to entertain.<ref name=\"Chou\" /> Using children's favorite characters and presenting products alongside concepts like fun, happiness, and well-being leads children to associate happiness with these foods without understanding the effects of eating only candy for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lauricella | first1 = A. | last2 = Gola | first2 = A.A.H. | last3 = Calvert | first3 = S.L. | year = 2011 | title = Meaningful characters for toddlers learning from video | journal = Media Psychology | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 216–232 | doi=10.1080/15213269.2011.573465}}</ref>\nWhile there are many studies that seek to prove that television plays a large role in causing childhood obesity, no concrete evidence can be found to support this claim. There is a correlational relationship between the two but no one can prove a causal relationship.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> There are numerous factors that contribute to a child's weight and eating habits; while media can have a significant impact on children and their food choices, their parents and friends may play an even more important role in determining childhood obesity.\n\n== Social factors ==\n\n=== External motivation ===\nChildren who are externally motivated to eat are at a higher risk for obesity. In one study,<ref name=\"Birch\">{{cite journal | last1 = Birch | first1 = L. L. | last2 = McPhee | first2 = L. | last3 = Shoba | first3 = B. | year = 1987 | title = Clean up your plate\": Effects of child feeding practices on the conditioning of meal size | journal = Learning and Motivation | volume = 18 | issue = 3| pages = 301–317 | doi=10.1016/0023-9690(87)90017-8}}</ref> two groups of children were told to focus on different prompts to eat: either external cues, such as the amount of food on their plate, or internal cues like hunger and satiety. The children who relied on internal cues were more likely to eat when they were hungry and stop when they were full. In contrast, the children who responded to external cues were more likely to ignore or overlook internal cues that indicated that they were full. Children who grow accustomed to relying on external hunger cues and thus eating more than their bodies need because are more likely to gain excess weight.\n\n=== Maternal employment ===\nThere is an association between the amount of time a mother works and her child's body mass index (BMI).\tThere is evidence that nonstandard maternal work schedules, meaning those that fall at least partially outside the “traditional” range of 9:00&nbsp;am to 5:00&nbsp;pm on Monday through Friday, are correlated with higher child BMIs.<ref>{{cite journal | pmc = 3070422 | pmid=21291429 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2010.01541.x | volume=82 | issue=1 | title=Maternal employment, work schedules, and children's body mass index | year=2011 | journal=Child Dev | pages=66–81 | last1 = Morrissey | first1 = TW | last2 = Dunifon | first2 = RE | last3 = Kalil | first3 = A}}</ref>\n\n=== Maternal depression ===\nMaternal depressive symptoms may be related to children's nutrition and physical activity, which in turn help determine weight status. Mothers with such symptoms are more likely to put their infants to bed with a bottle and less likely to have rules about what their children eat.<ref name=\"Morrissey\">{{cite journal | last1 = Morrissey | first1 = Taryn W | year = 2013 | title = Maternal Depressive Symptoms and Weight-Related Parenting Behaviors | journal = Maternal and Child Health Journal | volume = 18| issue = 6| pages = 1328–1335| doi=10.1007/s10995-013-1366-y| pmid = 24077962 }}</ref> They are also less likely to eat dinner with their children, and the children usually watch more TV per day than children with non-depressed mothers. All of these behaviors have been correlated with higher child BMI.<ref name=\"Morrissey\" /> However, identifying maternal depression early can reduce the effects on children's eating habits and weight.\n\n=== Family stress ===\nPsychological stress in a family may contribute to childhood obesity. Sources of such stress include serious life events, [[parenting stress]], lack of social support, and parental worries (e.g., the possibility of the child falling ill, being harmed, being handicapped, not developing normally, being exposed to abuse, or not surviving). In one study, children whose families reported stress in at least two of these four domains had significantly higher rates of obesity.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Koch | first1 = F. | last2 = Sepa | first2 = A. | last3 = Ludvigsson | first3 = J. | year = 2008 | title = Psychological Stress and Obesity | url = http://su.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:133520/FULLTEXT01 | journal = Journal of Pediatrics | volume = 153 | issue = 6| pages = 839–844 | doi=10.1016/j.jpeds.2008.06.016| pmid = 18657829 }}</ref>\n\n== Mental and emotional well-being ==\nObese children show more depressive symptoms, poorer self-esteem, and poorer body-esteem than their normal-weight peers; however, among obese children, increased BMI does not correlate to severity of mental health problems.

If they are surrounding themselves with peers who exercise daily and choose water over a sugary beverage are much more likely to want to do the same. On the other hand, if they are surrounded by an environment filled with bullying and shaming, their motivation to be healthy will deteriorate.\n\n=== Victimization ===\nBullying is more common toward obese children regardless of gender.<ref name=\"Janssen\" /> Children hold many stereotypes about obese people, including that they are lazy, selfish, and mean. Verbal bullying may lead obese children to internalize such stereotypes, and victimization of all types may elicit social withdrawal or retaliatory behaviors that confirm stereotypes.<ref name=\"Janssen\" /> Bullying increases with age for girls, but decreases for boys. It also appears that obese African-American and Hispanic girls experience less bullying than European-Americans,<ref name=\"Janssen\" /> which reflects the patterns of mental health as well as the differences in cultural attitudes about thinness. It appears that the cultural differences insulate these children from the stereotypes that lead to victimization.\n\n=== Social isolation ===\nIsolation and rejection can impact self-esteem directly and also stunt social development, thus contributing to social ineptitude that can affect future relationships.<ref name=\"Janssen\" /> Obese children list fewer friends than normal-weight peers and they have fewer reciprocated friendships. There is also evidence that their friendships are weaker than those among normal-weight children.<ref name=\"Strauss\" /> Time spent engaged with screen media positively correlates with depression, and physical activity correlates with number of friendships;<ref name=\"Strauss\" /><ref name=\"Janssen\" /> this suggests that certain obesity-promoting behaviors interfere with peer interaction: sedentary activities remove obese children from their peer group and limit opportunities to grow social networks.<ref name=\"Strauss\" /> Still, obese children typically have at least one reciprocated friendship.<ref name=\"Strauss\" /> Friendship buffers against both loneliness and the effects of bullying: self-disclosure to a close friend may help the victim cope with his/her experiences without rumination or internalization of problems. This improves self-esteem of physical appearance and decreases depressive symptoms.<ref name=\"Adams\">{{cite journal | last1 = Adams | first1 = R. E. | last2 = Cantin | first2 = S. | year = 2013 | title = Self-disclosure in friendships as the moderator of the association between peer victimization and depressive symptoms in overweight adolescents | journal = [[The Journal of Early Adolescence]] | volume = 33 | issue = 3| pages = 341–362 | doi = 10.1177/0272431612441068 }}</ref>\n\n=== Aggression ===\nObese adolescents display more aggression than normal-weight peers, particularly in terms of physical and verbal bullying. Such behavior reinforces negative stereotypes of obese people and further damages peer relationships. One possible explanation for this aggression is that obese children's lack of social support and friendly interaction stunts social development. Alternatively, obese children may seek to dominate their peers since they feel that they cannot gain approval through positive interaction. It is also possible that there is a “hierarchy of aggression,” such that obese children are merely reciprocating negative behaviors directed at them.<ref name=\"Janssen\" />\n\n== Treatment and prevention ==\nGiven the detrimental effects and rising prevalence of childhood obesity, much research has been conducted on how to prevent and treat the condition. It appears that addressing the psychology of obesity and modifying the family environment are important factors in regaining and maintaining a healthy weight.\n\n=== Psychological and behavioral methods ===\nThere is evidence that certain behavioral change techniques may help prevent or treat childhood obesity. A recent survey of the literature revealed six techniques that proved effective: providing information on behavior specific to the individual (e.g., “You should not eat so much sugar, like when you have candy after school.”), environmental restructuring, prompt practice, identification of a role model, stress management and emotional control training, and general communication skills training.16 While these techniques are useful, further research is needed to understand how they can best be incorporated into programs for at-risk or obese children. The survey also cites four management techniques that did not promote prevention or intervention: providing information on the consequences of behavior in general (e.g., “Eating too much sugar is bad for one’s health.”) did not promote effective intervention. In a similar vein, providing reward contingent on successful behavior and facilitating social comparison were not effective in preventing childhood obesity.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Martin | first1 = J. | last2 = Chater | first2 = A. | last3 = Lorencatto | first3 = F. | year = 2013 | title = Effective Behavior Change Techniques in the Prevention and Management of Childhood Obesity | journal = International Journal of Obesity | volume = 37 | issue = 10| pages = 1287–294 | doi=10.1038/ijo.2013.107| pmid = 23756676 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Many interventions center around promoting exercise and physical activity.

A recently published study found that “parental policies supporting child physical activity are warranted,” and that “aspects of a child’s home environment can promote physical activity and dietary intake” in a variety of ways.<ref name=\"Fisher\">Fisher, J.

''[[International Journal of Obesity]] 37'' (11), 954-60.</ref> Active parental promotion of physical activity and an environment conducive to frequent, safe physical activity increase a preschool child's physical activity and improve dietary intake; such early changes even make the child more likely to display these healthy behaviors at age ten.<ref name=\"Fisher\" /> Policies directed at parental behavior and the home environment are critical in order to prevent and treat obesity.<ref name=\"Fisher\" /> However, different socioeconomic groups and mothers with different levels of education experience different rates of success in? prevention and reduction in obesity, warranting further assessment of different strategies’ effectiveness for different groups.<ref name=\"Fisher\" />\n\n=== Self regulation ===\nResearch also emphasizes the importance of self-regulation skills in toddlers (and the promotion of self-regulation skills at all ages); the researchers concluded, “Self regulation skills in toddlers were associated with body mass index development and pediatric obesity eight years later. Early self regulation difficulties also contributed to body image and eating concerns that typically accompanied overweight children.”<ref name=\"Graziano\">{{cite journal | last1 = Graziano | first1 = P.

The company produced the [[Bulletin board system|BBS]] [[BBS door|door games]] ''[[Legend of the Red Dragon]]'', ''Planets: The Exploration of Space'' and ''[[Growtopia]]'', an experimental multiplayer creative sandbox created as a collaboration with Hamumu Software, released in 2013 for [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[Microsoft Windows]], and [[macOS]].\n\n==History==\n===The BBS era===\n\nIn 1989, Seth Robinson created a game that he called ''[[Legend of the Red Dragon]]'', or ''LORD'', in an effort to attract new users to his Amiga-based [[Bulletin board system|BBS]] that he ran at the time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lord.nuklear.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=9157|title=Nuklear LORD Forums|website=lord.nuklear.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-14}}</ref>  He was only 14 years old at the time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://diygames.com/index.php?p=718&more=1 |title=DIY Games |last=Games |first=DIY |website=diygames.com |language=en |access-date=2017-04-15 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060506111055/http://diygames.com/index.php?p=718&more=1 |archive-date=2006-05-06 }}</ref>  He later allowed others to port the game to other operating systems and BBS platforms.\n\nThe game exemplified how simple a game could be while still being fun. It is a text-based menu-driven fighting game, allowing players to take on the role of a potential dragon-slayer. It featured multiplayer options if its BBS host had multiple [[Node (networking)|nodes]] (or phone lines). The gameplay style that it featured was in many ways a predecessor to the MMORPG genre. The game would later feature a form of graphical menus, created and displayed by [[RIPTerm]].\n\nAnother feature of the game was In Game Modules or IGMs. These were little add-ons to the game, allowing for expansion. IGMs could be written by anyone and allowed for a lot of gameplay to be added on. Some IGMs even allowed \"mischievous\" game play, almost allowing players to cheat. Robinson only released a single IGM of his own, called ''Barak's House''.\n\nShortly afterwards, Robinson released a game called ''Planets: The Exploration of Space''. Commonly referred to as ''Planets: TEOS'', it was a [[space trading and combat simulator|space trading]] game that had players flying to various kinds of planets, buying, selling, and trading items in order to make money. The game allowed fights that were very similar in style to ''LORD'', allowing players to attack others when they were offline. Players could also attack planets in order to take control of them. Robinson describes the game as \"kind of like LORD mixed with [[Trade Wars|Tradewars]]\".<ref name=\"Robinson\">{{Cite web|url=http://rtsoft.com/pages/lordfaq.php|title=Robinson Technologies - LORD/BBS Frequently Asked Questions|last=Robinson|first=Seth A.|website=Robinson Technologies|language=en|access-date=2017-04-14}}</ref>\n\nThe game featured two sides, the Alliance and the Maraken. Players could join and fight for either side. Players could own planets for whichever side they belonged to. However, they could also play independently and start their own \"guilds\" called cartels. The game had a notable ''[[Star Trek]]'' influence, including references to the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] and characters from different ''Star Trek'' shows.\n\n''Planets: TEOS'' also featured IGMs, the major difference being that players had to travel to a particular planet to enter into that IGM.  Robinson only released one ''TEOS'' IGM of his own, called \"Landfill\", which was a ''[[Tetris]]'' clone.\n\nIn various releases of ''Planets: TEOS'', Robinson advertised a new game he had been working on. This game, ''New World'', would never see release due to reasons that were never made public. Instead, another of Robinson's games inherited the name, [[Legend of the Red Dragon#Legend of the Red Dragon II|''Legend of the Red Dragon II: New World'']]. Fans wanted a new game from Robinson and wanted ''New World'' as well, so he released the official sequel to his original hit, ''Legend of the Red Dragon''.\n\nThis game is completely different than the original ''Red Dragon''. Instead of a text-based menu concept, the game had an ANSI-based graphical map concept. Players controlled a smiley face-like character that could roam around, much like modern [[MMORPG]]s. The game was never as successful as the original ''Red Dragon'', but it did gather a cult following.\n\nEventually, Robinson sold the rights to the three BBS games to [[Metropolis Gameport]] in 1998.<ref name=\"Robinson\"/>\n\n====List of RTSoft BBS Door games and programs====\n* ''[[Legend of the Red Dragon]]''\n** ''Barak's House'' (a ''LORD'' IGM)\n* ''Planets: The Exploration of Space'' (or simply ''Planets: TEOS'')\n** ''Landfill'' (''TEOS'' In Game Module ''Tetris'' clone)\n* ''[[Legend of the Red Dragon#Legend of the Red Dragon II|Legend of the Red Dragon II: New World]]''\n* ''RTReader'' (BBS door that ran from a scripting language)\n* ''BradyBunch Adventure'' (multiplayer .DLL for MBBS/Worldgroup)\n* ''Tournament LORD'' (MBBS/Worldgroup .DLL port)\n\n===The PC era===\n\nIn 1997, Robinson Technologies released an adventure/[[Role-playing video game|RPG]] title by the name of ''[[Dink Smallwood]]''. This was an effort made by Seth Robinson to move away from BBS door games and into something more profitable. The title featured an isometric view and had a comedic focus.<ref name=\"KotakuDink\">{{cite web |url=http://www.kotaku.com.au/2014/08/a-criminally-underrated-game-about-a-pig-farmer/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824215029/http://www.kotaku.com.au/2014/08/a-criminally-underrated-game-about-a-pig-farmer/|url-status=dead|archive-date=24 August 2014|title=A Criminally Underrated Game About A Pig Farmer|last=Gidari|first=Cameron|date=24 August 2014|website=[[Kotaku]]|publisher=Allure Media|access-date=25 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn an attempt to keep the game's player-base active longer, Robinson took the idea of IGMs from ''Legend of the Red Dragon'' and created \"D-Mods\", an add-on feature where players could create their own adventure for others to explore. Anyone could create D-Mods and distribute them as they wished.\n\nOn 17 October 1999, Robinson Technologies released the game to the public for [[Freeware|free]], and now it can be downloaded without charge from their website. On 16 December 2011, a new version of ''Dink Smallwood'' called ''Dink Smallwood HD'' was released for [[iPhone]], [[iPad]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows XP/Vista/7]], [[webOS]], and [[Mac OS X]].<ref name=\"KotakuDink\"/><ref name=\"Dink Smallwood HD\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rtsoft.com/pages/dink.php|title=Robinson Technologies - Dink Smallwood|website=Robinson Technologies}}</ref>\n\nAfter ''Dink Smallwood'', Robinson worked on many programs, releasing most of them on the company website.  Notable releases include ''Teenage Lawnmower'', ''[[Dungeon Scroll]]'' and ''Funeral Quest''. He also worked on games for other companies like the ''Opening Weekend'' series for [[The Learning Company]] and developed several [[Browser games|Flash games]] for various websites.\n\n====List of RTSoft PC games and programs====\n\n* ''[[Dink Smallwood]]'' (WIN95 RPG; published by [[Iridon Interactive]])\n** ''Mystery Island'' (a Dink module released as a free add-on)\n* ''Opening Weekend: Varmit Season'' (published by The Learning Company)\n* ''Opening Weekend: Deer Season'' (published by The Learning Company)\n* ''Opening Weekend: Grizzly Season'' (published by The Learning Company)\n* ''Opening Weekend: Bear Season'' (published by The Learning Company)\n* ''Teenage Lawnmower''\n* ''[[Dungeon Scroll]]''\n* ''Funeral Quest'' (Flash game)\n\n===The mobile era===\n\nRobinson Technologies started developing games for the mobile device market in the early 2000s.

Cadurques, Gallic people of the Quercy, choose the site for its elevated position overlooking the Lemboulas and Petit Lembous valleys, which are easily defensible. The Roman occupation and the period of prosperity that accompanies it promote trade and open channels of communication . \" Moleriis \" is on the road between Tolosa (Toulouse) and Divona (Cahors).\n\nAfter many centuries of unrest and insecurity during the period of the \"Great Invasions\", the beginning of the twelfth century marks the return of prosperity for Molière . The fertile lands provide grain, the many mills that line the streams, produce beautiful flour.\n\nReligiously depending on the high priest of St. Vincent de Flaugnac, Molière's Ratier lord of Castelnau. It is in 1263 that people get permission to build a church dedicated to the Virgin (\"Beata Maria Molieriis\").\n\nIn May 1270, Alphonse de Poitiers, brother of Saint Louis, grants Molière a Charter of Customs, thus founding the fourteenth century Bastide Quercy. By new statutes, the village is protected by lordly power, placed under the authority of Bayle (representing the royal authority), accompanied by six consuls elected annually among the inhabitants . The Charter of Customs guarantees freedom of individuals, the protection of property and free bequest of such property. Each resident must participate in the defense of the Bastide, every man is obliged to provide military service for forty days.\nNew residents arrive and from 1338, the Bastide inhabits the highest part of the hill, protected by a wall and a watchtower (which dominate the village until 1993).\nThese defenses quickly become useful because the Black Death of 1348 arrives from the Languedoc, and the Anglo-French Hundred Years' War begins. In 1360, the Quercy is under English control, and Molière under French control, remained the northern boundary of the County of Toulouse. Molières lives behind its walls until the end of the war in 1450.\nIt is from this date that Molière finds prosperity and becomes in 1573 a Royal City. But this period is no less eventful. From 1562, Catholics and Protestants clash in the region. The church outside the walls will be attacked and destroyed in 1567. It will be rebuilt at the beginning of the seventeenth century.\n\nThe constant desire of people to better control their future, the quality and dedication of their consuls are rewarded in 1696 when Molière becomes the fourteenth city Quercy to send deputies to the Provincial States.\nIn the early eighteenth century, the growth of the city and its rich bourgeoisie become the center of an important trade network. However, this prosperity based on an agricultural economy, which is thwarted from 1785 to 1788 by major droughts followed by harsh winters.\n\nThe 1789 revolution and its attendant violence causes many problems in the city and Molière pays dearly as a royal city: its walls are destroyed, the bells melted to make cannons. It is not until the arrival of the Empire that passions subside.\n\nMolière becomes the centre of six parishes (Molière, Espanel Saint Amans, Saint Arthémie, Saint Kitts and Saint Nazaire) initially in the department of Lot, it changes with the creation of the department of Tarn et Garonne in 1808 by imperial decree of Napoleon. Molière is the capital of rural townships consisting of Auty, Labarthe, and Puycornet Vazerac.\nWith the economic and demographic expansion of the nineteenth century, the village extends along the communication path between Montauban and Cahors (the current main street Avenue de Larche ). The church is in disrepair and becomes too cramped to accommodate all the faithful, it will be completely rebuilt on the site of the cemetery (the latter will be transferred out of the village to Labarthe road). Opened in late 1898, of the original building, only the clock tower remains, now separate from the church.\nIn 1900, a new church square is built, plus a hall for poultry and an area for unloading. From this date, the carts do not have to mount the steep road which leads to the square of the old city. It soon become useless due to loss of markets, the hall will be demolished in the 1980s while the site will be redesigned in 2009.\n\nThe twentieth century will be marked by the end of the First World War, and a massive rural exodus that emptied the town of half its inhabitants. From the late 1980s, the trend finally reverses while Molière modernizes and turns to tourism with the construction of a leisure center, around a lake of 10 ha.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Communes of the Tarn-et-Garonne department]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Commons category|Molières (Tarn-et-Garonne)|Molières, Tarn-et-Garonne}}\n\n{{Tarn-et-Garonne communes}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Molieres}}\n[[Category:Communes of Tarn-et-Garonne]]"

He originally self-published [[minicomic]]s which presented dark vignettes and short stories, many of them [[dream art|directly inspired]] by [[dream]]s. He also produced [[short film]]s, mostly through community television stations.\n\nRickheit followed these up with a longer work, ''Kill, Kill, Kill''. In the late 1990s, Rickheit moved to the [[Boston]] area where he was deeply involved with the Zeitgeist Gallery located in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. With the support and assistance of the gallery's owner, Alan Nidle, he started a publication the short-lived publication ''Cambridge Inferno'' for more general audiences as a vehicle to showcase local cartoonists. He was also the gallery's projectionist, and programmed series' and comics festivals there and in the greater Boston area. He also dabbled in music and performance art, playing \"Doctor Selenium\" in a performance collaboration with musician [[Katt Hernandez]], and working on Empire S.N.A.F.U. Restoration Project events.\n\nIn 2001, he [[self-publishing|self-published]] the first edition of his original [[graphic novel]] ''[[Chloe (graphic novel)|Chloe]]''. A [[Xeric Foundation]] grant enabled him to produce a second and revised [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] edition of ''Chloe'' which received wider distribution and favorable reviews by the comics press. In 2003, Rickheit produced a color wraparound cover for the [[zine]] ''[[The Comics Interpreter]]'', which in that issue also published a long interview with him. More recently, Rickheit has had short stories published in a number of [[alternative comics|alternative]] [[independent comics|small press comics]] anthologies and periodicals and in ''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]'' weekly.\n\nRickheit relocated in [[Philadelphia]] after the Zeitgeist Gallery shut down in 2006, where he still released the occasional issue of ''Chrome Fetus'', his showcase for his own shorter works. From 2001 to 2009 he made [[performance art]] and designed album cover art for [[Katt Hernandez]], as well as designing cover art for Psychotic Quartet and most recently Archer Spade. ''The Squirrel Machine'' is his longest graphic novel to date. It was published by [[Fantagraphics Books]] in 2009 and subsequently translated into several languages.\n\nIn early 2010, he returned to rural Massachusetts{{citation needed|date=March 2021}} to live in a town so remote that it does not exist on most maps{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}. He presently creates ''Ectopiary'' and ''Cochlea and Eustachia'', both webcomics released semi-irregularly. ''Folly'', a collection of his earlier short works, was released by Fantagraphics Books in April 2012.\n\n==References==\n* [https://www.comicsreview.co.uk/nowreadthis/2014/12/21/cochlea-eustachia/ Biography]\n\n==External links==\n* ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20160704200011/http://ectopiary.webcomic.ws/ Ectopiary]'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20160704200011/http://ectopiary.webcomic.ws/ webcomic]\n* [http://chromefetus.thecomicseries.com ''Cochlea and Eustachia'' webcomic]\n* [http://www.fantagraphics.com/index.php?option=com_myblog&show=Hans-Rickheit-at-Home.html&Itemid=113''Hans Rickheit at Home''] a video at Fantagraphics.com\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120129040418/http://ehserecords.com/ehse016.html ''Katt Hernandez: Unlovely''] an album covered designed by Rickheit\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rickheit, Hans}}\n[[Category:American cartoonists]]\n[[Category:American comics artists]]\n[[Category:American performance artists]]\n[[Category:American webcomic creators]]\n[[Category:American comics writers]]\n[[Category:1973 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:People from Ashburnham, Massachusetts]]\n[[Category:Alternative cartoonists]]"

The [[protoconch]] is small, pointed and tapering of 3 or more, smooth, convex [[Whorl (mollusc)|whorl]]s followed by about 4 post-nuclear whorls. The sculpture consists of about 14 narrow ribs continuous from the [[siphonal canal]] to the upper suture and crossed by even, spiral cords. Their intersection form small rounded beds or tubercles. Immediately after the protoconch, there is but one spiral, soon followed by two and on the penultimate whorl there are three. The [[body whorl]] has five spirals and three or four more on the siphonal canal. The [[Aperture (mollusc)|aperture]] is elliptical with a large expanded outer [[Lip (gastropod)|lip]], smooth within and a deep, anal sinus at its upper end.

In the serial, [[List of Doctor Who villains#Count Grendel|Count Grendel of Gracht]] ([[Peter Jeffrey]]) kidnaps Prince Reynart (Neville Jason) and the alien [[Time travel in fiction|time traveller]] [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] ([[Mary Tamm]]), along with the fourth segment of the powerful Key to Time, as part of his plot to become the legitimate King of Tara.\n\n==Plot==\nThe [[Fourth Doctor]] and [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] arrive on the planet Tara in search of the fourth segment of the Key to Time. While the Doctor goes fishing, Romana finds the fourth segment. She is attacked by a native Taran bear and saved by Count Grendel, who takes Romana to his castle on the pretext of treating her injured ankle. Once there, it becomes clear that Grendel believes she is an android, because she exactly resembles the captive Princess Strella. When Grendel finds Romana is instead flesh-and-blood organic, she is imprisoned in Grendel's dungeon.\n\nThe noble swordsmen Zadek and Farrah recruit the Doctor to assist Prince Reynart, who must reach the throne room of the castle in time to be crowned king or forfeit his crown to Grendel. The Doctor agrees to help repair an android copy of the Prince to be used as a decoy to distract Grendel's men. Grendel strikes first, drugging the Prince and his retinue and kidnapping Reynart. When the Doctor and the swordsmen recover, they decide to crown the android Reynart instead. The Doctor and his party sneak the android Prince into the throne room, and the Prince is crowned King.\n\nTill, Grendel's manservant, arrives at the Reynart estate and offers the Doctor a chance to collect Romana. It turns out to be a trap; the real Romana has been replaced by an android. K9 detects the android Romana and eliminates it. Meanwhile, the real Romana escapes from Castle Gracht and helps the Doctor flee. Grendel, coming under a flag of truce to secretly offer the crown to the Doctor, destroys the Reynart android and recaptures Romana. The evil Count now plots to have Romana pose as Strella and marry the real King Reynart. Once they are married and she is his Queen, Reynart will be killed, leaving Grendel free to marry her and become King of Tara.\n\nThe Doctor has K9 assist him to gain access to the castle by means of the moat and tunnels. The Doctor reaches the throne room just in time to stop Reynart's coerced marriage to Romana. He then engages the Count in a deadly duel with electro-swords, eventually defeating him and forcing him to flee. Romana has meanwhile freed Strella who is finally reunited with Reynart. Having retrieved the fourth segment of the Key to Time, the Doctor, Romana and K9 depart.\n\n==Production==\n[[Mary Tamm]] designed Romana's distinctive purple outfit after the originally planned costume proved unsuitable.<ref>DVD commentary</ref> Although Tamm was a skilled horse-rider, she refused to do the horse-riding sequence herself because she could not wear a helmet and felt that the potential of an accident was too great.

The film was released as ''The Fatal Orchids'' in the [[United Kingdom]]. The feature stars [[Cleo Madison]], [[Francis McDonald]] and [[Dick La Reno]]. Ingram later remade the film as ''[[Trifling Women]]'' (1922).\n\n''Black Orchids'' is considered a [[lost film]].<ref name=PSFL/><ref name=LOC/>\n\n==Plot==\nThe synopsis released by the studio as printed in ''Motography'' reads:<ref name=Motog1702/>\n\n{{Blockquote|text=The story is told as one a novelist relates to his daughter to warn her against waywardness.

Weitzel also commented on Ingram's direction, saying: \"While no points of the plot are glossed over or left in doubt, there is no undue stress put upon any of the incidents and the atmosphere which surrounds the entire story belongs to it by right of birth.\"<ref name=MPW3101/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of lost films]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=AFI>{{cite web |title=Black Orchids |work=Catalog of Feature Films |publisher=American Film Institute |url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&Movie=14471 |accessdate=2015-10-21}}</ref>\n<ref name=PSFL>{{cite web |editor=Carl Bennett |title=Black Orchids |work=Progressive Silent Film List |date=January 13, 2004 |url=http://www.silentera.com/PSFL/data/B/BlackOrchids1917.html |accessdate=2015-10-21 |via=Silent Era}}</ref>\n<ref name=LOC>{{cite web |author=David Pierce |title=Black Orchids/Rex Ingram |work=American Silent Feature Film Survival Database |publisher=Library of Congress |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov:8081/diglib/ihas/loc.mbrs.sfdb.3790/default.html |accessdate=2015-10-21}}</ref>\n<ref name=soister>{{cite book |author=John T.

Jana Chrzciciela).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Saint John church]]\n[[File:Sokolowa Malopolski 1905-1918 (71359344) (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Market square, ca 1905-1918]]\nThe history of Sokołów Małopolski starts with a forest settlement, located in once extensive [[Sandomierz Forest]], which the sources describe as far as the 14th century. In 1569, Sokołów received a town charter, with a Renaissance street plan and a market square in the centre. In 1608, the town was looted by [[Stanislaw Stadnicki]], a well-known troublemaker and the so-called “Devil of [[Łańcut]]”, but after this incident, Sokolow continued to prosper. In 1657, during the [[Deluge (history)|Swedish invasion of Poland]], Sokolow was destroyed by [[Transilvania]]n army of [[George II Rakoczi]].\n\nFollowing the [[First Partition of Poland]], Sokołów was in 1772 annexed by the [[Habsburg monarchy|Habsburg Empire]], and remained in Austrian [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] until late 1918. The town burned in fires in 1863 and 1904, and did not prosper. In the [[Second Polish Republic]], Sokolow belonged to [[Lwow Voivodeship]], and even though it was located in the [[Central Industrial Region (Poland)|Central Industrial Region]], no plant was opened here, and the promised rail line was not built.\n\nIn the 17th century, the town was protected by fortifications with five gates and moat. Sokolow has a 17th-century Jewish cemetery, and a parish church (1908–1916). Today, due to numerous wars and fires, there are only buildings from the 19th and 20th centuries. In 2010, local villagers helped to clean up the Jewish cemetery, though without the cooperation of local officials who reportedly said they didn't want to cooperate with Jews.<ref>{{cite web |title=Polish Villagers Clean Up Jewish Cemetery |url=https://www.jpost.com/jewish-world/jewish-news/polish-villagers-clean-up-jewish-cemetery |publisher=Jerusalem Post |accessdate=July 19, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAt the time of the German [[invasion of Poland]] in September, 1939, Sokołów Małopolski's Jewish population was about 1,600. The Germans immediately requisitioned Jews for [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labor]]. In April 1942, the Jewish population, then numbering 3,000 because of refugees and others resettled by the Germans in Sokołów Małopolski, was forced into a [[Jewish ghettos established by Nazi Germany|ghetto]]. In July, German police shot 30 residents of the ghetto, resettled 200 in a labor camp in Głogów, and moved others to the Rzeszów ghetto where they were sent to the [[Belzec extermination camp]] in July. Several dozens of Jews who hid from the deportations were murdered later in the year and in the summer of 1943, three Jews and the four Poles [[Rescue of Jews by Poles during the Holocaust|hiding them]] were shot and buried on the grounds of Sokołów Małopolski's elementary school.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Megargee |first1=Geoffrey |title=Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos |date=2012 |publisher=University of Indiana Press |location=Bloomington, Indiana |isbn=978-0-253-35599-7 |page=Volume II, 577–579}}</ref> The number of the few Jewish survivors is unknown.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.sokolow-mlp.pl/ Official town webpage]\n*[http://www.sokolow-mlp.go.pl/ Old Sokolow Malopolski photographs]; taken about 24 years ago.\n\n{{Commons category|Sokołów Małopolski}}\n\n{{Gmina Sokołów Małopolski}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Cities and towns in Subcarpathian Voivodeship]]\n[[Category:Rzeszów County]]"
